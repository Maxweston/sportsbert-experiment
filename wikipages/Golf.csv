https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Abbott,Golf,,,Margaret Ives Abbott June 15 1878 – June 10 1955 2 was an American golfer She was the first American woman to win an Olympic event the women s golf tournament at the 1900 Paris Games Born in Calcutta India Margaret Abbot was the daughter of Charles and Mary Abbott 3 Charles died when Margaret was very young and after his death Mary moved the family to Boston 3 When Abbott was a teenager her mother became the literary editor of The Chicago Herald and the family then moved to Illinois 3 After moving to Illinois she and her mother were members of the Chicago Golf Club where she learned how to golf She began winning championships at local tournaments and was consistently featured in the Chicago Tribune newspaper 3 Mary and Margaret Abbott lived in Paris from 1899 to 1902 4 While in Paris Mary researched a travel guide and Margaret studied art with Rodin and Degas 3 At the 1900 Paris Olympics 22 women competed out of a total of 997 athletes 5 It was the first time women were allowed to compete in the Olympic Games and they could only compete in five sports golf tennis sailing equestrianism and croquet 6 The 1900 Olympics stretched over six months and was a sideshow of the Paris Exhibition which is also known as the World Fair 5 Since the competition was so stretched out it was sometimes hard to track who competed in the competition and who did not The Olympic events were referred to as the Championnats Internationaux or International Championship instead of the Olympic Games 7 There was also a lack of media attention as unlike today the Olympics did not have either an opening ceremony or closing ceremony The women s golf tournament was held on October 4 1900 at a nine hole course at Compiègne north of Paris 8 Durning this time women were perceived to be harmed from playing sports because of how physical it is so they were limited to a nine hole course compared to the 18 standard hole course people play with today Golf Illustrated referred to the medal event as The international golf competition recently held in connection with the Paris Exhibition 9 The games were organized like any other small golf tournaments and barely publicized so Abbotts did not realize that the events she entered was part of the Olympics Historical research did not establish that the game was on the Olympic program until after Abbott s death in 1955 so she never found out that she was the first American women to win the Olympics 3 Additionally Abbott s victory was not well known until a University of Florida professor and member of the Olympic Board of Directors Paula Welch researched the golfer and began to put together pieces of Abbott s life She spent a decade examined newspaper articles that mentioned Abbott s successes in various golfing competitions in an attempt to gain more information In the end she also located Abbott s children and informed them of their mother s victory 10 Part of the reason Abbott was not widely known was due to the lack of media attention the Olympics got in the 1900s and the fact that it was not a widely recognized competition This was due to the fact she was residing in France and studying art while her mother was working there as a writer Abbott competed because she played golf and happened to be in France 3 5 In the 1890s Abbott initially learned to play the sport as a member of the Chicago Golf Club where her mother also a member played the sport 5 She won the Olympics with a 9 hole score of 47 8 Abbott was awarded a porcelain bowl for first place in golf 11 Gold medals were only given out starting from 1904 in the Olympic game of St Louis these gold medals made the Olympics more competitive and a sense of achievement for winners All the competitors played in long skirts and fashionable hats 3 and according to Abbott she apparently misunderstood the nature of the game scheduled for the day and turned up to play in high heels and tight skirts 4 Mary Abbott also entered the competition She shot a 9 hole score of 65 and finished tied for seventh 6 12 This was the only time in Olympic history that a mother and daughter competed in the same sport in the same event at the same Olympics 5 It is much harder for this ordeal to happen in today s Olympic games as the threshold to compete is much higher Women s golf would not be seen again at the Olympics until the 2016 Games in Rio 3 Margaret Abbott married the writer Finley Peter Dunne on December 10 1902 They had four children together Finley Peter Dunne Jr Peggy Dunne Leonard Dunne and Phillip Dunne who later became a noted screenwriter Abbott continued to play golf as she helped raise her children 3 Abbott died at age 76 on June 10 1955 in Greenwich Connecticut 3 In 1996 Abbot was the featured athlete of the 1900 Olympic Games in the official Olympic program of the Atlanta games 12 In 2018 The New York Times published a belated obituary for her 3 Margaret Abbott Contents

golf as a nine year old caddie at Belmont Country Club carrying bags for Francis Ouimet and Alexa Stirling At the age of 12 he became the youngest caddie master in America collecting five cents from every boy who carried a bag As a young man he worked for the Massachusetts Golf Association with Donald Ross at Pinehurst and as the official scorer for the United States Golf Association Among his innovations was the first tournament leaderboard that reflected birdies pars and bogies marked in different colored crayons a method that caught on immediately and is used around the world today In 1936 he became the PGA Tour s tournament manager and the business manager of Sam Snead During the 1940s he took golf from a minor curiosity to a major business He later served as the PGA s Promotions Director until 1948 Both idea man and publicist with a pinch of hustler thrown in Corcoran raised the awareness and business of golf through many avenues In 1940 he put together a charity match between Gene Tunney Babe Ruth Gene Sarazen and Jimmy Demaret where he brought the Fred Waring band and Colonel Stoopnagel of radio fame to follow the match with a sound truck offering an absurd commentary A year later he arranged for a three course match between Ty Cobb and Babe Ruth which allowed them to settle their long term rivalry on the golf course He established golf s first Hall of

exhibitions with the help of Bing Crosby and Bob Hope and bringing sports shows to the troops with Lefty Gomez and Jack Sharkey From the mid 1930s to the late 1940s there was some friction and dispute on the PGA Tour over Corcoran s perceived conflict of interest as a personal manager of certain tour players at the same time he was promoting and running tournaments where those players competed against others There was also controversy over how Corcoran should be paid for his services to the Tour and expenses incurred doing his jobs the Tour was at the time still a loosely run evolving branch of the PGA of America with little structure or assigned responsibilities and chain of command for the weekly tournaments around the large country Few disputed Corcoran s skills and worth but budgets were tight and prize moneys low in the wake of the Great Depression and professional golf in the USA was but a shadow of what it would become decades later Corcoran was fired and re hired

superstars Ted Williams and Stan Musial Corcoran s own modest self described claim to fame is that he three putted in 48 counties In 1955 Corcoran took over the ailing Canada Cup which traveled the globe to promote international goodwill through golf with team and individual championships The Canada Cup became the World Cup and was played under Corcoran s direction until his death in 1977 The World Cup introduced to the world such international stars as Seve Ballesteros Greg Norman Gary Player and Roberto De Vicenzo it was supported during this period by the top American stars such as Sam Snead Arnold Palmer Jack Nicklaus and Lee Trevino who traveled the world to compete in it The World Cup became a significant championship and had an invaluable role in broadening golf s international profile and appeal Corcoran also worked as Tournament Director for the Thunderbird Classic and the Westchester Classic golf tournaments which were at the time the richest in golf He managed the business of Champagne Tony Lema Ken Venturi and Tom Weiskopf He orchestrated the move from the AFL to the NFL by New York Giant placekicker Pete Gogolak In 1975 Corcoran was inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame in the lifetime achievement category and he won the William D Richardson Award in 1960 In 1964 he published his autobiography Unplayable Lies His daughter Judy updated reorganized

Molder who needed to par the hole in order to insure earning the Temporary Card said Sometimes the hardest thing in the world is to two putt when you have to For the remainder of the season though his

finishes in 25 tournaments Molder defeated Briny Baird on the sixth hole of a sudden death playoff for his maiden PGA Tour win The win capped a superb weekend of near flawless play for Molder who went bogey free –13 in the final 43 holes of regulation play and –4 in the playoff He sank a 12 foot putt for birdie on the final hole of regulation play to square things just after Baird playing one group behind Molder dramatically chipped in from 38 feet from the green side rough for eagle on the 17th hole temporarily taking a one stroke lead When Baird parred the 18th hole the playoff ensued with neither player – each seeking his first Tour win after years of trying – able to close it out until Molder s dramatic approach from 133 yards in the 18th fairway to six feet set up his conclusive birdie putt The win extended Molder s Tour membership through 2013 7 In 2017 while attending the ceremony for his induction into the Arkansas Golf Hall of Fame he announced his retirement from professional golf saying I had gotten to the point that it was just not fulfilling anymore 2 PGA Tour playoff record 1–0 Note Molder never played in the Masters Tournament LA = low amateur CUT =

https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Alister_MacKenzie,Golf,,,Alister MacKenzie 30 August 1870 – 6 January 1934 was a Scottish golf course architect whose course designs span four continents Originally trained as a surgeon MacKenzie served as a civilian physician with the British Army during the Boer War where he first became aware of the principles of camouflage During the First World War MacKenzie made his own significant contributions to military camouflage which he saw as closely related to golf course design 1 He is a member of the World Golf Hall of Fame He designed more than 50 golf courses including three that remain in the 2016 top 10 golf courses in the world 2 Augusta National Golf Club and Cypress Point Club in the US and Royal Melbourne Golf Club West Course in Australia MacKenzie was born in Normanton near Leeds in Yorkshire England to parents of Scottish extraction His mother Mary Jane Smith MacKenzie had family roots in Glasgow His father William Scobie MacKenzie a medical doctor had been born and raised in the Scottish Highlands near Lochinver Although christened after his paternal grandfather Alexander he was called Alister Gaelic for Alexander from birth As a youth MacKenzie and his family spent summers near Lochinver on what had been traditional Clan MacKenzie lands from 1670 to 1745 MacKenzie s strong identification with his Scottish roots featured prominently in many aspects of his later life 3 MacKenzie attended Queen Elizabeth Grammar School Wakefield before going to Cambridge University where he initially trained as a medical doctor graduating in 1891 with a B A Natural Science Tripos Part 1 with honours third class before the next year undertaking and passing a second MB Bachelor of Medicine Latin Medicinae Baccalaureus Anatomy After a period working in Leeds he returned to Cambridge in 1895 where he undertook the third MB examination Part 1 before passing the London Licentiate examinations for Royal College of Surgeons the same year Finally in 1897 he graduated from Cambridge University with MB BacS Bachelor of Surgery and MA degrees 4 MacKenzie served as a surgeon with the Somerset Regiment in South Africa during the Second Boer War During his wartime service MacKenzie became interested in camouflage which was effectively used by the Boers As a result during the First World War when he once again served in the army he worked not as a surgeon but as a camoufleur In a lecture he gave on the subject when he said that the brilliant successes of the Boers during his service in South Africa were due to great extent to their making the best use of natural cover and the construction of artificial cover indistinguishable from nature 5 MacKenzie had been a member of several golf clubs near Leeds dating back as far as the late 1890s These included Ilkley between 1890 and 1900 and Leeds Golf Club from 1900 to 1910 4 In 1907 he was one of the founding members of The Alwoodley Golf Club where he was both honorary secretary 1907 1909 and club captain 1912 1913 and he remained on its green committee until 1930 As the course was MacKenzie s original design when Alwoodley was laid out it was his first opportunity to put many of his design theories to practical test However the committee at the time thought that some of his ideas were too expansive so it called in Harry Colt for a second opinion Colt was one of the leading golf course architects of the time and was also the secretary of Sunningdale Golf Club Colt visited on two occasions only first on 31 July 1907 when he met MacKenzie for the first time and later on 6 October 1909 On the first occasion four months after the course opened for play having stayed at MacKenzie s house overnight he realized that MacKenzie s ideas were very much an extension of his own and he gave great support for MacKenzie s ideas at the meeting with the committee He did however mention the bunkering as MacKenzie s ideas had taken into account the new technology of the day which was the Haskell wound ball which bounced and rolled and was now being used instead of the old gutta percha golf ball Some of MacKenzie s modern ideas under discussion included undulating greens long and narrow greens angled from the center of the fairway fairly large and free form bunker shapes and substantial additional contouring All of these remained part of his signature style throughout his career 3 In 1914 MacKenzie won a golf hole design competition organized by Country Life the adjudicator was Bernard Darwin MacKenzie then took an active interest in course improvements at his own clubs gaining experience in the newly emerging discipline of golf course design He charted the Old Course at St Andrews in great detail by 1915 he had become a member of the R A In March 1924 he produced a map which remains well known to the present day 6 Following the First World War MacKenzie left medicine and began to work instead as a golf course designer in the United Kingdom in association with Harry Colt and Charles Alison in 1919 with whom he formed the London firm of Colt MacKenzie Alison 7 Four years later MacKenzie went his own way MacKenzie thought he had learned a lot about golf course planning from having designed camouflage There are references to the latter in his first book on course design called Golf Architecture MacKenzie 1920 such as when he writes that there is an extraordinary resemblance between what is now known as the camouflage of military earthworks and golf course construction 8 or later when he states that there are many other attributes in common between the successful golf architect and the camoufleur Both if not actually artists must have an artistic temperament and have had an education in science 9 In the same book he also writes that the chief object of every golf course architect worth his salt is to imitate the beauties of nature and presumably also the hazards so closely as to make his work indistinguishable from nature itself 10 His book was later included in Herbert Warren Wind s Classics of Golf Library MacKenzie worked in an era before large scale earth moving became a major factor in golf course construction and his designs are notable for their sensitivity to the nature of the original site citation needed As a player MacKenzie was self described as a good putter but a mediocre ball striker for most of his life It was not until after his move to California when he was already in his 60s that MacKenzie had what he described citation needed as his golfing epiphany This was an improvement in his ball striking which enabled him to often score in the high 70s to low 80s for 18 holes He described this in one of his books as in the 70s after 60 6 MacKenzie was one of the first prominent golf course designers who had not been a leading player 3 In the late 1920s he moved to the United States where he carried out some of his most notable work although he continued to design courses outside that country as well Today he is remembered as the designer of some of the world s finest courses among them Century Country Club Purchase New York as MacKenzie was partners with Colt Alison at the time the two built Century from mid 1923 he was working with other partners when he designed Augusta National Golf Club Augusta Georgia Cypress Point Club Monterey Peninsula California Royal Melbourne Golf Club Melbourne Australia Pasatiempo Golf Club Santa Cruz California Crystal Downs Country Club Frankfort Michigan Lahinch Golf Course Lahinch Ireland and Meadow Club Fairfax California see extended list of his courses below MacKenzie died in Santa Cruz California in January 1934 two months before the inaugural Masters Tournament then known as the Augusta National Invitational Tournament

sponsor of the tournament but Northern Trust became the title sponsor beginning in February 2008 The five year agreement which extended through the 2012 event was announced October 15 2007 by PGA Tour Commissioner Tim Finchem and William A Osborn Chairman and CEO of Northern Trust Corporation 29 The tournament became known as the Northern Trust Open and the new partnership marks the beginning of a process of transformation for this high profile tournament As part of the initial move to enhance the tournament the Northern Trust Open increased its purse to $6 2 million in 2008 an increase of $1 million over 2007 Additionally the tournament pro am went from four amateurs to three per group After the initial 5 year agreement it was extended 4 years to cover Northern Trust s partnership through the 2016 event Phil Mickelson won the 2008 tournament and successfully defended the title in 2009 with a one stroke victory over Steve Stricker In 2010 Stricker came back to win the Northern Trust Open and secure his ranking of the number two player in the world In 2016 Bubba Watson won the tournament for a second time in three years holding off Adam Scott and Jason Kokrak to win by one shot with a 15 under par total 30 Following the demise of The National tournament after 2018 which was run by the Tiger Woods Foundation the Genesis Open was converted to an invitational for 2020 with a larger purse and a smaller field 31 The Genesis Invitational is one of only five tournaments given invitational status by the PGA Tour and consequently it has a reduced field of only 120 players as opposed to most full field open tournaments with a field of 156 players The other four are the Arnold Palmer Invitational RBC Heritage Charles Schwab Challenge and the Memorial Tournament Invitational tournaments have smaller fields between 120 and 132 players and have more freedom than full field open tournaments in determining which players are eligible to participate in their event as invitational tournaments are not required to fill their fields using the PGA Tour Priority Ranking System Furthermore unlike full field open tournaments invitational tournaments do not offer open qualifying aka Monday qualifying The winner is granted a three year tour exemption rather than two Beginning in 2020 the invitational field consists of 120 players invited using the following criteria 32 In 2009 the tournament designated one unrestricted exemption for a player who represents the advancement of diversity in golf The exemption is called the Charlie Sifford Memorial Exemption in honor of pioneering black golfer and 1969 tournament winner Charlie Sifford 33 34 35 36 While most of the recipients have been of African American descent the 2015 exemption went to PGA Tour rookie Carlos Sainz Jr of Filipino and Bolivian descent 37 and the 2016 recipient J J Spaun is also of Filipino descent 38 The 2018 exemption went to Cameron Champ who nine months later became the first past recipient of this exemption to win on the PGA Tour when he won the Sanderson Farms Championship in the fall portion of the 2019 season In 2020 Joseph Bramlett became the first two time recipient of the award 39 Source 2 3 Sixteen men have officially won this tournament more than once through 2020 Coordinates mw parser output geo default mw parser output geo dms mw parser output geo dec{display

California Duval made an eagle on the final hole to win the tournament by one shot Before 1999 only two other golfers in PGA Tour history Al Geiberger and Chip Beck had posted a 59 in competition and no one had ever done so in a final round 9 When he won the Players Championship he became the first player in history to win on the same day as his father Bob Duval who won a Champions Tour event that same day 10 He also played on the victorious 1999 Ryder Cup team as well as the 2002 team After his Open Championship win Duval entered a downward spiral in form that saw him drop to 80th on the money list in 2002 and 211th in 2003 prompting an extended break from the game Numerous reasons have been postulated for the decline including back wrist and shoulder problems personal difficulties and a form of vertigo Duval has not won a tournament on the PGA Tour since his Open Championship victory in 2001 His last worldwide win was the Dunlop Phoenix Tournament in November 2001 on his 30th birthday His 30s proved to be much less lucrative on the golf course 11 Many commentators believed Duval s career to be over but he returned to golf at the U S Open in 2004 where he shot 25 over par and missed the cut Duval struggled with his best results until 2009 being a T 13 at the Deutsche Bank Championship in 2004 and a T 16 at the U S Open in 2006 He made the cut in only one PGA Tour event in 2005 but did finish in the top ten at the Dunlop Phoenix tournament in Japan Duval had a successful start to the 2006 season making the cut in his first two tournaments as well as a very respectable finish of T 16 at the U S Open at Winged Foot Golf Club where his second round 68 was good enough for a tie as the best round of the tournament Despite not reaching the same heights in the remaining two majors of the year his performances continued a general upward trend with none of the rounds of 80+ that had become so familiar in the previous years After a steady start to 2007 during the West Coast Swing Duval once again disappeared from the tour His mother died on July 17 3 and he later revealed that his wife was going through a difficult pregnancy This prompted the PGA Tour to amend its medical exemption policies – and Duval was granted twenty starts for the next season After a lackluster first half of the following year Duval reappeared on the leaderboard of the 2008 Open Championship rekindling memories of his major victory He shot 73 69 83 71 for the week and finished T 39 12 In 2009 Duval used his final career money exemption on the PGA Tour He made his first cut at the AT T Pebble Beach National Pro Am in February However he stormed back onto the golf scene with a T 2 finish at the U S Open at Bethpage Black After going through sectional qualifying Duval made the most of his first appearance in the U S Open since 2006 Going into the final round Duval was four shots behind eventual winner Lucas Glover Duval made a triple bogey at the par three 3rd hole but rebounded with three straight birdies from 14 to 16 He stood on the tee of the 71st hole in a tie for the lead but his par putt lipped out on the hole and he finished tied for second two shots behind Glover It was his best finish on tour since the 2002 Memorial Tournament After the Open Duval jumped 740 spots in the Official World Golf Ranking from 882 to 142 13 14 Duval failed to earn his PGA Tour card for the 2010 season so he had to play on sponsor s exemptions He showed more signs of a comeback by shooting a final round 69 to finish 2nd to defending champion Dustin Johnson at the 2010 AT T Pebble Beach National Pro Am Duval had a good 2010 season and retained his tour card at the end of the year The 2011 season was a struggle for Duval when he made only nine cuts in 24 events and lost his Tour card after finishing outside 150th on the tour money list He went to Q School in an attempt to regain his tour card but finished T72 in the final round For 2012 Duval had past champion status After seven unsuccessful starts Duval made his first cut of the season at the Valero Texas Open and finished T60 It was announced on June 13 that he would be an analyst for ESPN for the first two rounds of the U S Open having failed to qualify for the 2nd major of the season 15 16 In December 2013 Duval announced via his Twitter that the 2014 PGA Tour season would be the last season he would ask for sponsor exemptions to get into tournament fields Many people took this as a possible retirement announcement but Duval clarified to say that he wants to earn his way back on the Tour rather than depending on others 17 18 In April 2014 Duval finished tied for 25th −8 at the Zurich Classic of New Orleans In addition to playing in tournaments Duval has helped commentate The Open Championship 19 and U S Open 20 In 2015 Duval joined the Golf Channel as a studio analyst In 2018 U S captain Jim Furyk named Duval as a non playing vice captain for the U S team participating in the

https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Edith_Cummings,Golf,,,Edith Cummings Munson March 26 1899 – November 20 1984 popularly known as The Fairway Flapper was an American socialite and one of the premier amateur golfers during the Jazz Age 1 She was one of the Big Four debutantes in Chicago during World War I 2 3 She attained fame in the United States following her 1923 victory in the U S Women s Amateur 4 On August 25 1924 she became the first golfer and first female athlete to appear on the cover of Time magazine 1 5 She also was the literary model for the character of Jordan Baker in F Scott Fitzgerald s novel The Great Gatsby 6 Cummings was born on March 26 1899 to David Mark Cummings and his wife Ruth Dexter 7 8 She had a younger brother Dexter 7 8 and a younger sister Dorothy who died in infancy in December 1902 8 Cummings had a privileged upbringing and was regarded by the Chicago press as a member of the city s elite Big Four debutantes circa World War I 2 3 This exclusive quartet consisted of Cummings Ginevra King Courtney Letts and Margaret Carry The four debutantes often went to dances and house parties together and they were seen as a foursome on the golf links and tennis courts at Onwentsia 2 3 Edith s father David Cummings was a Yale alumnus and Chicago banker 8 He paid for her to attend the Westover School a prestigious finishing school in Middlebury Connecticut 3 Edith was in the class of 1917 Though the school had been founded only in 1909 by headmistress Mary Robbins Hillard 9 the institution attracted young women from many prominent families 9 Cummings classmates included fellow Chicago socialite Ginevra King future philanthropist Katharine Ordway Isabel Rockefeller of the Rockefeller family a granddaughter of William Rockefeller and Prescott Bush s sisters Mary and Margaret aunts to U S President George H W Bush and great aunts to George W Bush 10 In 1915 while either at Westover School in Connecticut or at Lake Forest Illinois 3 Cummings met a young Princeton University student named F Scott Fitzgerald 3 He had fallen in love with her close friend and Westover schoolmate Ginevra King He would later immortalize both of them in his 1925 novel The Great Gatsby 6 Fitzgerald based the character of Jordan Baker in The Great Gatsby upon Cummings just as the character Daisy Buchanan was modeled after Cummings friend King 6 Much like King and Cummings Buchanan and Baker were wealthy socialites and intimate friends Baker à la Cummings wore all her dresses like sports clothes — there was a jauntiness about her movements as if she had first learned to walk upon golf courses on clean crisp mornings 6 In the novel Baker is the love interest of the novel s narrator Nick Carraway and she purportedly cheats at golf but there is no evidence that Fitzgerald drew this particular detail from Cummings 6 Fitzgerald reportedly created the name of Cummings character by combining the names of two car manufacturers the Jordan Motor Car Company and the Baker Motor Vehicle 11 Following her graduation from Westover School in 1917 Cummings pursued tournament golf where she garnered the sobriquet of the Fairway Flapper 1 In 1919 she qualified to compete in the U S Women s Amateur for the first time 12 Cummings and her brother Dexter had learned to play golf from their parents at the Onwentsia Club in Lake Forest Illinois 8 Both her father and mother had been club champions Edith had won the club championship in 1918 Her sibling Dexter won the intercollegiate championship in 1923 and in 1924 and the Western Amateur championship in 1925 13 In 1921 Cummings competed in the British Ladies Amateur with other famous female golfers such as Alexa Stirling and Marion Hollins The next year Cummings entered the U S Women s Amateur where she was in match play against Glenna Collett then an 18 year old from Rhode Island who became known as one of the great female golfers of the 1920s Cummings lost on the final hole She won the U S Women s Amateur in 1923 13 4 earning her the cover photo on Time as well as profiles in Vogue Ladies Home Journal and many newspapers 1 She also won the Women s Western Amateur in 1924 Cummings never won another tournament and left tournament golf in 1926 14 but remained a well known figure In 1934 she married wealthy Detroit businessman Curtis B Munson who had accrued a considerable fortune in coal and lumber interests 15 16 During their marriage Curtis Munson served as a clandestine U S intelligence operative engaging in espionage activities against the Japanese Empire under the direction of Assistant Secretary of State Adolph Berle 16 In 1940 at the behest of President Franklin D Roosevelt Munson investigated the sympathies of Japanese Americans living in the United States before the U S entered World War II and authored the Munson Report 17 16 In his report Munson was highly critical of accusations that Japanese American citizens would serve as fifth column saboteurs and he concluded that the average Japanese American was an extremely good citizen and it is only because he is a stranger to us that we mistrust him 16 Cummings and Munson largely retreated from the public spotlight later in life except for forays into philanthropy Cummings remained a committed golfer into her 80s She was enthusiastic about all outdoor activities especially big game hunting in the Yukon and fishing 13 She and her husband traveled extensively throughout their marriage until her husband s death in 1979 In his honor she made a significant contribution to the Decatur House renovation in Washington D C Today the Curtis and Edith Munson Foundation funds a number of conservation programs 18 She has an award named after her the Edith Cummings Munson Golf Award given annually to one of the top female collegiate golfers who excels in academics 19 The Curtis and Edith Munson Foundation donates $5 000 to the general scholarship fund of the winner s school 19 Edith Cummings Contents

https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Joanne_Winter,Golf,,,Joanne Emily Winter Jo November 24 1924 – September 22 1996 was a pitcher who played from 1943 through 1950 in the All American Girls Professional Baseball League Listed at 5 ft 8 in 1 73 m 138 lb she batted and threw right handed 1 Winter was one of the sixty original members of the All American Girls Professional Baseball League A three time All Star and twice a member of the Champion Team she also posted several records over her eight year career in the league Winter is also one of seven pitchers with 100 or more wins in AAGPBL history ranking in third place with 133 victories behind Helen Nicol 163 and Jean Faut 140 2 Following her baseball career she excelled as a master teacher of golf for 30 years A native of Chicago Illinois Joanne Winter was the daughter of George Winter and Edith née Watson Winter of German and Scottish origins respectively The young Winter attended Proviso Township High School in Chicago Athletically inclined she participated in basketball soccer swimming volleyball track and field tennis and handball as a youth near Chicago At age 11 she joined the Oak Park Coeds softball team In addition she spent much of her free time training in a gymnasium owned by Jocko Conlan a local hero and an umpire with Major League Baseball experience 3 Winter dropped out of school at 15 to play softball for the Parichy Roofing Company well known as a Bloomer Girls team and later joined the Admiral Music Maids of the National Women s Softball League She later moved with her family to Phoenix Arizona where she played for the Arizona Ramblers At 18 she heard about Philip K Wrigley and his remarkable experiment in creating a womens professional baseball league 4 5 During World War II Wrigley was in charge both of the Wrigley Company and the Chicago Cubs Major League Baseball club Wrigley decided to found the All American Girls Professional Baseball League as a promotional sideline to maintain interest in baseball as the military draft was depleting Major League rosters of first line players Wrigley approached other Major League team owners but the idea was not well received Then four non Major League cities were selected that were in close proximity to the AAGPBL headquarters in Chicago and close to each other Rockford of Illinois South Bend of Indiana and Racine and Kenosha of Wisconsin Publicist Arthur Meyerhoff was given the responsibility of coordinating operations with city officials and civic leaders in the communities as well as a projected budget was developed The first spring training of the new league was set for May 17 1943 at Wrigley Field in Chicago After four years of semiprofessional competition Winter tried out for the AAGPBL 6 Since the only organized ball for women in the country was softball the league created a hybrid game which included both softball and baseball Wrigley had scouts all over the United States Canada and even Cuba signing girls for tryouts About 500 girls attended the call Of these only 280 were invited to the final try outs in Chicago where 60 were chosen to become the first women to ever play professional baseball The league started with the four teams aforementioned and each team was made up of fifteen girls Winter survived the final cut and was assigned to the Racine Belles where she played for the next eight seasons 7 Winter posted an 11–11 record in 1943 helping the Belles win both the first half of the season and AAGPBL championship In the best of five Series Racine defeated the Kenosha Comets winners of the second half 3 games to 0 She also was selected for the All Star Game which was the first night game played at Wrigley Field July 1 1943 8 But each year the field dimension changed as the league came closer to emulating the game played by the men s major leagues The pitching mound was raised the pitching distance was lengthened the ball shrank from season to season the basepaths were extended and two new teams were added until sidearm pitching was allowed in 1946 Winter had a hard time dealing with the changes as she struggled to keep mentally focused recording a 22–45 mark between 1944 and 1945 Then she learned from a Mexican hurler how to pitch a sidearm sling shot delivery 9 The rising pitch baffled hitters and transformed her in one of the best pitchers of the league most notably when the league expanded from six to eight teams 10 In 1946 Winter earned 33 victories for only nine losses while pitching 17 shutouts with 183 strikeouts in 46 pitching appearances Winter s 33 wins tied her with Connie Wisniewski for most victories in a regular season She also set all time records of 63 consecutive scoreless innings and six consecutive shutouts was selected an All Star and led Racine capture another pennant and championship The Belles finished in first place with a league best 74–38 record won the semifinal round of playoffs by defeating the South Bend Blue Sox in four games and clinched the title after beating the 1945 AAGPBL champions Rockford Peaches four games to two Throughout the playoffs Sophie Kurys was the biggest Belles star She led all players in average stolen bases and runs scored On the other hand Winter collected four wins in all series including three against Rockford despite allowing 19 base runners in a 1–0 shutout victory over the Peaches in decisive Game Six The winning run was scored by Kurys on an RBI single by Betty Trezza The Belles also showed a great defense notably by left fielder Edythe Perlick right fielder Eleanor Dapkus first sacker Margaret Danhauser shortstop Trezza and Maddy English at third 11 12 13 Winter went 22–13 with 121 strikeouts in 1947 leading her team again to the playoffs Racine defeated the Muskegon Lassies three games to one but lost to the Grand Rapids Chicks in the final Series four games to three Winter was able to make the adjustment to overhand pitching before the 1948 season when Leo Murphy former Pittsburgh Pirates catcher and Belles manager helped her convert to a three quarters delivery during spring training She responded by leading the league with 256 strikeouts and 329 innings while tying in victories 25 with Alice Haylett joining the All Star team for a third time and helping Racine garner another pennant The Belles lost the semifinal playoff to the Peaches the eventually winners of the Championship Title 14 A durable and consistent pitcher Winter fell victim to the new rules She had a shoulder that could not take the new pitching motion and also developed back problems compiling a 20–25 record in her last two seasons At the end of 1950 the Belles lacked the financial resources to keep the club playing in Racine and opted to move to Battle Creek Michigan for the 1951 season Winter along with original Belles Dapkus English Kurys and Perlick were disappointment and decided not to make the move During eight years the Belles were a close knit team always like a family away from home Winter and teammates thought that all would be different like a new team maybe a new manager and specially a new location 15 Winter moved back to Arizona in the late 1960s and Sophie Kurys lived across the street from her home in Scottsdale Arizona until after Winter s death in 1996 16 After that Winter and several other primarily underhand pitchers rejoined the Admirals of the National Girls Baseball League for a higher salary The team paid Winter $150 a week and gave her a $400 bonus for winning 25 games She competed four more years in the league and returned to Phoenix Arizona in 1955 to pitch for the Phoenix A 1 Queens In 1958 she posted 36–6 record and led her team to the State Women s championship 17 Winter an accomplished athlete taught and played tennis and golf in Arizona Her ability to compete in two professional sports marked a rarity for women in the 1960s She won the Arizona State Women s Golf championship four times and joined the Ladies Professional Golf Association in 1962 competing in 25 tournaments Her LPGA career ended in 1965 due to a back injury caused by an auto accident 18 One of 14 original Master Professionals in the LPGA Teaching and Club Professional Division Winter found her niche as a master teacher of golf for 30 years She tutored many students from beginners to tour professionals including Danielle Ammaccapane Jerilyn Britz Julie Stanger Pyne Heather Farr and Alice Miller among other important golfers Her contacts through those years brought her to visit her former employer Philip K Wrigley By then Wrigley stood in front of the Chicago Cubs and was also the owner of the Arizona Biltmore Resort Through this contact Winter was able to have one day of the tournament at the Biltmore with no charge for green fees She also scheduled courses in the Scottsdale area free of charge as well since the tournament was usually held during the hot summer Founder of the Arizona Silver Belle Championship Golf tournament she also coached women s golf at Scottsdale Community College and Arizona State University 19 In November 1988 Winter along with her former baseball teammates and opponents received their long overdue recognition when the Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in Cooperstown New York dedicated a permanent display to the All American Girls Professional Baseball league But like many of her AAGPBL colleagues Winter was relatively unknown until the 1992 film A League of Their Own by filmmaker Penny Marshall was exhibited for the first time During the pre production phase she joined several former AAGPBL players as consultants for the film 20 Winter also received many honors and awards including LPGA Teacher of the Year in 1969 and the Ellen Griffin Rolex award in 1995 This award named after one of the best known female teachers in American golf history recognizes individuals who have demonstrated by their teaching skill the same spirit love and dedication possessed by Griffin Besides this Winter was inducted into The National Women s Baseball Hall of Fame in 2005 21 22 23 The unselfish Winter excelled in two sports and shared her expertise with thousands of students young and old She died in Scottsdale Arizona at the age of 71 24 Joanne Winter Contents Overview profile edit Early life edit Birth of the AAGPBL edit AAGPBL career edit Pitching statistics edit Other

https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Chick_Evans,Golf,,,Charles E Chick Evans Jr July 18 1890 – November 6 1979 was an American amateur golfer of the 1910s and 1920s Evans who won the 1910 Western Open became the first amateur to win both the U S Open and U S Amateur in one year a feat he achieved in 1916 Evans won the U S Amateur again in 1920 and was runner up three times Selected to the Walker Cup team in 1922 1924 and 1928 he competed in a record 50 consecutive U S Amateurs in his long career Evans achieved all of this while carrying only seven hickory shafted clubs In addition to his golf career Evans is known for founding the Evans Scholars Foundation which provides a college scholarship for qualified caddies In 1960 Evans was voted the Bob Jones Award the highest honor given by the United States Golf Association in recognition of distinguished sportsmanship in golf He is a member of the World Golf Hall of Fame Born in Indianapolis Indiana Evans family moved to Chicago when he was eight years old and he grew up on the north side of the city His father Charles Evans was one of the most influential librarians of the 20th century At the age of eight he was first exposed to golf as a caddie at a Chicago course the Edgewater Golf Club He attended secondary school at the Evanston Academy and won the 1907 and 1908 Western Interscholastic tournaments He led in the founding of the Western Interscholastic Golf Association WIGA and led Evanston Academy to the 1908 WIGA team championship 2 From these beginnings Evans became one of the most acclaimed American amateur golfers of his time The accomplishment that gave him the most contemporary publicity came in 1916 when he won both the U S Amateur and U S Open in the same year Evans was the first person to accomplish this task and only Bobby Jones has done it since Evans also won the Western Open in 1910 by defeating George Simpson 6 and 5 in the 36 hole final He was the only amateur to do so until Scott Verplank in 1985 3 Simpson graciously praised Evans on his victory saying I ve learned the greatest golf lesson of my life today I consider it a greater honor to be beaten by the kind of golf you have played than to have remained out of the tournament because I did not fancy match play 4 Into the 1960s Evans was an active participant in senior tournaments and still competed in U S Amateur events eventually setting a record of completing 50 of these championships Evans played his last rounds of competitive golf in 1968 winning the Illinois Open that year His last Western Amateur was in 1967 1 After his retirement Evans continued to attend events as a spectator and converse with the fans and players After his wins in 1916 Evans was given several thousand dollars in royalties for recording golf instructions for the Brunswick Record Company and in 1921 he received royalties from a golf book 5 If he had accepted this money Evans would have lost his amateur status His mother suggested that he put the money to good use by sponsoring a scholarship fund for caddies Evans who was unable to finish his own matriculation at Northwestern University recalled that his mother wouldn t think of accepting my money unless we could arrange it to be trusted to furnish educations for deserving qualified caddies He said his mother pointed out that the money came from golf and thus should go back into golf It was all her dream her idea Evans went to the Western Golf Association WGA an organization that ran the golf championships in the Midwest to get their support for his scholarship By 1930 the Evans Scholars Foundation had formed 3 and two caddies Harold Fink and Jim McGinnis were named the first two Evans Scholars Chick Evans long friendship with Chicago tax attorney Carleton Blunt had proved to be the catalyst for launching the Evans Scholars Foundation Blunt an avid golfer and philanthropist supported Evans vision for helping caddies attend colleges and universities across the country by raising the necessary funds for decades The criteria used to choose the recipients were scholarship fellowship and leadership Since that time over 10 600 caddies have become Evans Scholars and attained college educations The Evans scholarship program continues today as the largest scholarship organization in sports and the largest privately funded scholarship program in the United States Evans Scholarship houses exist at the following Universities University of Colorado University of Illinois Northwestern University Marquette University University of Wisconsin Purdue University Ohio State University Northern Illinois University University of Missouri Indiana University University of Michigan Michigan State University Miami University and the University of Minnesota On February 19 2014 the Evans Scholars Foundation announced their plans to build a new chapter house at the University of Oregon It is the first new Scholarship House in 27 years 6 In addition to those universities at which houses exist scholarship recipients attend several other universities around the country More than 800 caddies currently attend college on an Evans Scholarship Evans died on

back on and think what could have been Although the two of them are multiple major championship winners both share disappointment in majors Their disappointments have ranged from nerves bad luck and

Jack Nicklaus Lee Trevino Billy Casper Raymond Floyd John Henry Taylor and Harry Vardon Tiger Woods has since become the ninth 21 Els win also marked the third major champion out of the previous four

Her paternal grandfather was a visiting professor and an aunt and uncle are both graduates 8 9 She enrolled in September 2007 as a freshman but as a professional golfer Wie was not eligible under NCAA rules to play for Stanford s golf team 10 11 During her first three years at Stanford she attended only during the fall and winter quarters running from late September through mid March each year 12 She took leaves of absence during the rest of the year to play professional golf 13 14 Wie completed her studies at Stanford in March 2012 with a major in communications She participated in the university s graduation ceremony in June 2012 15 16 Wie began playing golf at the age of four In 2000 at the age of ten she became the youngest player ever to qualify for the U S Women s Amateur Public Links Championship Eight years later Wie s mark was surpassed by fellow Hawaiian Allisen Corpuz who qualified when she was five months younger than Wie had been when she set the record 17 Wie remained the youngest player to advance to match play in this tournament until 2014 when Lucy Li surpassed her by one week 18 In 2001 at the age of 11 she won both the Hawaii State Women s Stroke Play

fourth and youngest female to play a PGA Tour event Her second round score of 68 was the lowest ever by a woman in a PGA Tour event though she went on to miss the cut in the tournament While missing the cut by 1 stroke she bettered the 36 hole score of 47 men including 4 major winners and matched the scores of 15 more men including 3 more major winners This in itself was an utterly incredible achievement by a 14 year old girl At age 16 2 years later she shot another round of 68 in the men s tour Sony open and bettered the 36 hole score of 18 men including 2 major winners and matched the score of 9 others including 1 major winner 22 She again played in the LPGA Kraft Nabisco Championship finishing fourth As part of the victorious U S team she became the youngest woman ever to play in

turning professional She signed sponsorship contracts with Nike and Sony reportedly worth more than $10 million per year When Wie turned professional she was not a member of any professional tour LPGA Tour membership age requirements require a golfer to be 18 although some players such as Morgan Pressel and Aree Song have successfully petitioned for an exemption to join at age 17 Wie chose not to request an exemption and was thus only allowed to participate in a limited number of LPGA Tour events when given a sponsor s exemption from 2005 until 2008 Wie played her first professional event in the 2005 LPGA Samsung World Championship where she was disqualified from a fourth place finish for signing an incorrect scorecard A journalist Michael Bamberger reported a day after Wie had completed her round that she had illegally dropped the ball closer to the hole than its original lie Wie would later go on to tally four top 5 finishes on the LPGA tour including a second at the Evian Masters a tie for third at the Kraft Nabisco Championship and a tie for 5th at the LPGA Championship In the initial Rolex World Golf Rankings in February 2006 Wie was placed third behind Annika Sörenstam and Paula Creamer but eventually dropped to 7th partially due to a limited schedule 25 2006 also involved several competitions against male competitors starting with the PGA Tour Sony Open where she again missed the cut this time by four strokes In May she became the first female medalist in a local qualifier for the men s U S Open but did not advance past the New Jersey final stage qualifier 26 At the

the European and Asian tours At the SK Telecom Open a men s tournament in South Korea she became the second woman after Se Ri Pak to make the cut on the Asian Tour and in addition reportedly received appearance fees exceeding the event s total prize money 28 However Wie finished the season with several disappointing performances in both male and female tournaments including the Omega European Masters PGA 84 Lumber Classic LPGA Tour Samsung World Championship and the Casio World Open At this point Wie had played 14 consecutive rounds of tournament golf without breaking par and had missed the cut in 11 out of 12 tries against men and remained winless against the women 29 In 2007 Wie s slump continued including a four month hiatus due to injuries to both wrists a disqualification and several missed cuts and withdrawals At the LPGA Ginn Tribute Hosted by Annika she was 14 over par through 16 holes in the first round before withdrawing citing the injury 30 The withdrawal was controversial owing to the LPGA Rule of 88 which states that a non LPGA member shooting a score of 88 or more is forced to withdraw and banned from LPGA co sponsored events for the rest of the year 31 32 Later that year after finishing one stroke off the lead during the second round of the State Farm Classic she was disqualified for walking outside of the official tournament area before returning to sign her scorecard 33 34 Despite the lack of victories Wie was ranked #4 in the 2007 Forbes Top 20 Earners Under 25 with an annual earnings of $19 million 35 Wie finally became eligible to play full time on the LPGA Tour in 2009 when she tied for 7th place at the LPGA qualifying tournament in Daytona Beach 36 After passing LPGA Qualifying School in December 2008 Wie declared that she still planned to play in tournaments against men However for the second consecutive year she did not receive a sponsor exemption to play in the Sony Open in Hawaii where she had played four years in a row from 2004 through 2007 37 38 Her first tournament as an LPGA member was the season opening SBS Open at Turtle Bay where she shot 66 70 to move into a tie with Angela Stanford going into the final round of the tournament Wie held a three stroke lead with eight holes remaining but ended up losing to Stanford by three strokes It was reported in early March 2009 that Wie had left the William Morris Agency the Hollywood talent agency that had represented her since she turned pro in 2005 and would be signing with sports agency IMG 39 At the second major of the year the LPGA Championship she finished tied for 23rd her best finish in a major since 2006 During this tournament she also scored her first recorded hole in one as a professional 40 However the day after her final round of the LPGA Championship she failed to qualify for the U S Women s Open due to a mediocre performance at a sectional qualifying tournament 41 42 In August at Rich Harvest Farms golf course in Sugar Grove Illinois Wie was a captain s pick for the United States team in Solheim Cup competition where she led the American squad to victory with a 3 0 1 performance the best record on the American team 43 On November 15 2009 Wie won her first professional individual tournament the Lorena Ochoa Invitational in Guadalajara Mexico an event on the LPGA Tour limited to the top 36 female golfers in the world as determined by the LPGA money list and Rolex women s world golf rankings posting a score of thirteen under par 275 for a two stroke margin over fellow American Paula Creamer and beating Jiyai Shin Cristie Kerr and Morgan Pressel by two strokes 44 45 46 She then finished second in the Ladies European Tour season ending Dubai Ladies Masters tournament on December 9–12 2009 shooting a 15 under par 273 which put her three shots behind winner In Kyung Kim 47 On August 29 2010 she posted a three shot win over a full field at the CN Canadian Women s Open held at St Charles Country Club in Winnipeg Manitoba for her second career professional victory 48 In her next LPGA event two weeks later she finished second in the 54 hole P G NW Arkansas Championship shooting 201 −12 and losing to Yani Tseng by one stroke after giving up an overnight three stroke lead 49 On April 19 2014 Wie won her third LPGA Tour event – and her first in the United States – the LPGA Lotte Championship She was four strokes behind Angela Stanford after 54 holes but shot a 67 to Stanford s 73 to win by two strokes 50 On June 22 2014 Wie won her fourth LPGA Tour event and first major championship the U S Women s Open She was tied for the lead with Amy Yang after 54 holes at two under par She double bogeyed the 16th hole to fall within one shot of Stacy Lewis but birdied the next hole and parred the last hole for a final round par 70 to win by two strokes over Lewis 51 The win coupled with her second place finish in the 2014 Kraft Nabisco Championship resulted in her winning the inaugural Rolex Annika Major Award 52 In 2014 she was also named one of ESPNW s Impact 25 53 Wie will contribute to CBS Sports multimedia golf coverage including the Masters starting in 2020 54 From the beginning of her public career Michelle Wie was the subject of controversy expressed by fans media peers and other observers Despite the publicity her appearances garnered Wie made only one cut in a men s tournament at the rain shortened 2006 SK Telecom Open on the Asian Tour She made no cuts on the PGA Tour After she missed the cut at the 2007 Sony Open by 14 shots many sports critics began to doubt whether she ever would 55 Wie s last appearance in a men s professional event was at the 2008 Legends Reno Tahoe Open an alternate event on the PGA Tour Wie shot rounds of 73 and 80 missing the cut by nine strokes 56 Professional golfers fans and media critics remarked that allowing Wie to compete in PGA events took away opportunities from more deserving golfers 57 58 59 By late 2007 the criticism over the use of exemptions had extended to Wie s participation in women s events on the LPGA Tour as well Wie declined to enter LPGA Tour qualifying school after turning 18 and therefore would have to depend on sponsor exemptions to play in future LPGA tournaments This decision drew criticism from golf fans and commentators 60 61 Such criticism ended after Wie qualified for the LPGA Tour through the 2008 qualifying tournament 62 Early in her career Wie employed many different caddies after her father stopped being her caddie in 2004 She created controversy when after finishing tied for 26th at the 2006 British Open her caddie Greg Johnston was fired over the phone by Wie s then agent Ross Berlin Johnston said he was surprised and disappointed at the firing and at the fact that no one named Wie gave me the news 63 Wie employed several other professional caddies after Johnston and also returned to using her father for the remainder of the 2007 season parting ways with caddie David Clarke after she missed the cut at that year s British Open For much of 2009 Wie used on loan caddie Patrick Tarrant who worked for then injured PGA pro Brett Wetterich however at the end of that year but prior to her first LPGA victory Tarrant recommended that she work with his friend Brendan Woolley who continued as her exclusive caddie through the 2010 season 64 Woolley and Wie parted ways in December 2012 after finishing 64th on the LPGA Money List and earning just $158 546 that season 65 In January 2013 Wie employed Mark Wallington who caddied for another LPGA professional and European Solheim Cup player Sophie Gustafson for three tournaments Wie then began working with Duncan French who has continued caddying for her exclusively since In the first week of February 2007 it was reported that Wie hurt her left wrist in a fall while running 66 However little information was provided to the public due to concerns about her privacy 67 Initially her public relations staff reported that she would be away from golf for 4 to 6 weeks 68 but the injury lasted until the end of May In response to the lack of information and prolonged absence Brittany Lincicome questioned whether Wie and her parents had fabricated the injury in order to give her a reason to take a break from golf 69 70 71 At the Ginn Tribute Hosted by Annika in May 2007 Wie s playing partner Alena Sharp questioned Wie s withdrawal from the tournament due to wrist injury 72 However Wie s other playing partner Janice Moodie stated that she heard Wie say Ouch! after hitting her tee shot and confirmed She didn t swing as hard from that point on 73 In April 2008 she announced that she had three broken bones in her wrist despite her agent s March 2007 announcement that the wrist was not broken 74 A 2009 article about Wie s injury stated that the original misinformation resulted from Wie and her family failing to understand or accept the severity of the injury and that during the entire 2007 season Wie played under a great deal of pain taking four to five pain killers a day 75 In March 2019 Wie announced that she was engaged to be married to Jonnie West who is Director of Basketball Operations for the Golden State Warriors 76 and is the son of NBA legend Jerry West They married on August 10 2019 at a private home in Beverly Hills California 77 In January 2020 Wie announced she was pregnant with a daughter 78 and has expressed interest in eventually returning to competitive golf 79 On June 19 2020 Wie gave birth to her daughter Makenna Kamalei Yoona West 80 Wie won several other Hawaiian local and junior events during the years 2000 through 2002 83 84 Wie played her first professional event while still an amateur in February 2002 Prior to her first win in a

https://wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Low_Jr.,Golf,,,George Anderson Low Jr July 5 1912 – April 10 1995 was an American professional golfer and noted putting instructor and designer of golf putters Low was also one of golf s greatest—and unabashed—hustlers He once reportedly said Show me a millionaire with a bad backswing and I can have a very pleasant afternoon He was also reputedly one of the best putters the game has ever known 2 Counselor of putting to Arnold Palmer and his contemporaries Low was renowned both as a player and a teacher of this most fragile art—the sure putting stroke Low died in Illinois on April 10 1995 at the age of 82 George Low was born in Springfield New Jersey in 1912 3 He was the son of Scottish American golf professional George Low Sr He grew up on Baltusrol Golf Club where his father was the head professional and actually lived on the grounds Low stated that he putted on the practice greens there as a child for four years before he ever stepped on a golf course to play an actual round He would not actually take up the game until he was 15 years old Low was active on the PGA Tour in the 1930s through the 1950s Although a fine player he was better known as a designer of putters His Sportsman Wizard 600 model was used most famously by Jack Nicklaus in the prime year of his career He was a putting instructor for Arnold Palmer Jack Nicklaus and Lee Trevino among others In the late 1940s Low contracted with the Hansberger brothers owners of Sportsman s Golf now Ram Golf to manufacture the fine line Wizard putters under both the Sportsman and Bristol brands The George Low autograph Wizard 600 was produced and is now considered one of the world s most collectible golf clubs sometimes carrying a $25 000+ price tag 4 In 1936 Low was the head professional at Plymouth Country Club in Plymouth Meeting Pennsylvania and the following year he served as assistant at the Manufacturers Golf Country Club in Fort Washington Pennsylvania He subsequently assisted his father at a driving range in Jenkintown Pennsylvania 1 Low was also one of the best putters the game has ever known 2 Low wrote with Al Barkow his only book The Master of Putting which was published in 1983 In the book Low reveals the secrets of his amazingly dependable putting technique addressing stance grip tempo and the other putting fundamentals Low s physical appearance was described by Los Angeles Times golf writer Jim Murray as … built along the general lines of a Chicago Bear linebacker he had the gruff exterior of a Balkan border guard and he tried not to say anything good about anybody—it destroyed his image But actually he had a left ventricle full of fudge 5 —Low on hustling high handicappers The 1957 Masters Tournament champion Doug Ford stated that George Low was the greatest putter I ever saw outside of Tiger Woods George could putt with his foot better than most guys could with their putter That s the truth I saw him beat a guy in Havana Florida for $35 000 putting with his foot 6 Low s father George Low Sr 1874–1950 was a noted Scottish professional golfer who had four professional wins The highlight of his father s career was a T2 finish in the 1899 U S Open Low was one of the great characters of 20th century golf World Golf Hall of Fame member Dan Jenkins described him in his book The Dogged Victims of Inexorable Fate as follows He is all at once America s guest 1 underground comedian consultant inventor of the overlapping grip for a beer can and more importantly a man who has conquered the two hardest things in life—how to putt better than anyone ever and how to live lavishly without an income 1 Low once stated I had been a test pilot for Foot Joys forever I test their $65 alligator models to see if standing in them for long periods of time in a bar brings any serious harm and what effect spilling beer has on them Low s idol wasn t a golfer it was the jockey Willie Shoemaker Low told golf writer Jim Murray putting a two ounce ball into a four inch hole is nothin compared to putting a 1 200 pound horse through a one foot hole on the fence 5 Low would achieve his 15 minutes of fame on the golf course rather than at the track He would often remind other pros that he was the one who broke Byron Nelson s string of 11 consecutive tour victories in 1945 It was complicated—most things with Low were An amateur Fred Haas actually won the 1945 Memphis Invitational Open but as an amateur he couldn t take the prize money Instead as low professional in the event Low waltzed away with the cash Nelson tied for fourth There are many legends and half truths that have been written spoken and whispered about George s remarkable putting ability There are wild tales of George putting with a rake a shovel a pool cue or a broom handle and defeating an opponent who was using a legitimate club There are stories of George kicking a ball with his foot and acing five out of nine holes in one round on the practice green Other stories hint that George has given putting secrets to people like Arnold Palmer Bing Crosby and Willie Mays that have enabled them at certain moments to display divine touches on the greens And there are stories that in the old days George took so much money away from the tour champs in friendly putting games after tournaments were over that as George said I shoulda been given a speeding ticket I win so fast 7 Although Low never played in the Masters he was a friend and sometimes putting mentor of four time champion Arnold Palmer who gave Low some credit after finishing birdie birdie to win his second green jacket in 1960 The only thing I did on those putts Palmer said at the time was keep thinking what my old friend George Low always says Keep your head down and don t move More infamously from behind the gallery ropes Low called Palmer over to congratulate him on the 18th fairway during the final round in the 1961 Masters shortly before Palmer made a sloppy double bogey to hand the title to Gary Player who just happened to be using a George Low signature putter manufactured after Palmer s win in 1960 With that exposure George was suddenly more than a mystery man and began being sought out by sports writers around the country Low died on April 10 1995 at the age of 82 8 9 George Low Jr Contents Early life edit Golf career edit Death edit

https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Hobens,Golf,,,John Owen Jack Hobens 25 October 1880 – 25 March 1944 was a Scottish American professional golfer He was born in Dunbar Scotland to Thomas Hoben and Elizabeth Annie Owen He learned the game of golf by starting out as a caddie Jack had five brothers and a sister Both of his parents were alcoholics so young Jack being the eldest was often tasked with caring for his younger siblings From the age of eleven he was a licensed caddie and was granted his professional ticket at the West Links Golf Club on 13 December 1894 at the age of fourteen 1 Hobens entered the 1899 Open Championship at Royal St George s Golf Club located in Sandwich England After shooting a disappointing 90 in the first round he withdrew but the experience he gained competing against Harry Vardon James Braid and Willie Park Jr would give him confidence to continue his aspirations to be a successful golf professional Hobens emigrated to the United States in January 1900 and was accompanied on the journey by Tom Anderson Sr the former North Berwick head greenkeeper and his son Thomas Jr the brother of U S Open champion Willie Anderson Hobens was appointed pro at Yountakah Country Club in Nutley New Jersey and Tom Anderson Sr took up a position ten miles away at Montclair Country Club In April 1901 Hobens moved less than five miles to Glen Ridge Golf Club and George Thomson from North Berwick took over at Yountakah In 1907 Hobens married an Irish girl Delia Agnes Lally 1881–1969 and together they would have a house full of children eight in all 2 At the time of his marriage he changed his surname from Hoben to Hobens On 17 January 1916 Rodman Wanamaker a keen amateur golfer and heir to the Wanamaker department store fortune now Macy s held a meeting at the Taplow Club in the Hotel Martinique on the corner of Broadway and West 32nd Street in New York City for the purpose of forming the Professional Golfers Association of America The luncheon was attended by several leading amateurs and 35 professionals including Hobens The entire group comprised the Charter Members 3 Hobens was one of seven chosen to make up the original organizing committee and one of three professionals who wrote the PGA s first constitution and by laws The committee met several times at Hotel Martinique in Manhattan before the constitution fashioned on the British PGA was approved on 10 April 1916 when their first business was conducted The first PGA Championship was held in 1916 at the Siwanoy Country Club in Bronxville New York and Jim Barnes—after defeating Jock Hutchison in the final match—hoisted the Wanamaker Trophy 3 In the winter of 1916 Hobens was employed in the golf department on the top floor of Wanamaker s store in New York John D Dunn was head of the 18 member teaching staff and the list of instructors read like a who s who of golfers from the period and the facility was the largest of its kind in the city For seventeen years Hobens—who was sometimes called Pop 4 —served as the head professional at Englewood Country Club He would go on to enter many U S Open tournaments during his playing career often finishing in the top ten He was described as a long hitter of the ball and generally deadly on the green 5 He had a wonderful opportunity to win the 1907 U S Open at Philadelphia Cricket Club He was the third round leader but finished poorly with a 12 over par 85 in the final round In the second round of the tournament he made the first ever U S Open hole in one by holing his tee shot at the 147 yard 10th hole 1 Hobens was victimized with some horribly bad luck in the 1904 North and South Open at Pinehurst North Carolina After 36 holes of regulation play he was tied for first place with Alec Ross The two players went to a playoff where Hobens was one shot ahead with just a few holes to play He hooked his tee shot into the left rough on the hole but had an easy unobstructed shot to the green Upon making his backswing his clubhead hooked a weed or a creeper as it was called by Jerome Travers which caused his ball to move Hobens unable to stop his stroke proceeded to miss the ball completely The unfortunate result was a one stroke penalty for causing the ball to move and another stroke for the whiff He ended up losing the tournament 6 7 Hobens won the 1908 Metropolitan Open at Baltusrol Golf Club in New Jersey by one shot over Alex Campbell and won the first prize of $150 8 In 1909 the U S Open was played at Englewood Golf Club where he was the professional at the time and he played well finishing tied for fourth place Hobens finished second in the 1906 Western Open which at that time was considered a †major tournament 9 In the Eastern Professional Golfers Association Four Ball Tournament held at Rumson Country Club Rumson New Jersey on 9 August 1911 Hobens was paired with Jack Dowling They won the event easily by posting a round of 68 and beat the second place team of Jack Jolly and Tom Anderson Jr who carded a round of 74 The winners received a gold medal and $125 in prize money 10 While serving as the head professional at the Knickerbocker Country Club in Tenafly New Jersey Hobens provided golf lessons to the famous aviator Charles Lindbergh and his family 11 Hobens was afflicted with a physical disability and retired at the age of 60 12 He and his wife Delia had eight children five daughters and three sons At the time of his death all three sons were serving in the Marine Corps in World War II All three survived the war Hobens died on 26 March 1944 at his home in Englewood New Jersey 13 In 2004 the PGA opened a historical center at PGA Village in Port St Lucie Florida where Hobens was one of the original inductees into the PGA Golf Professional Hall of Fame His granddaughter Barbara Hobens as well as her family were invited guests at the PGA s 90th anniversary celebrations at the Radisson Hotel Martinique New York City in 2006 11 Pulitzer Prize winner and Golf Digest contributing editor Dave Anderson of The New York Times who lives in Tenafly and knew Hobens said The tour pros are the show of golf but the club pros are the

https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Tour_Championship,Golf,,,"The Tour Championship stylized as the TOUR Championship is a golf tournament that is part of the PGA Tour It has historically been one of the final events of the PGA Tour season prior to 2007 its field consisted exclusively of the top 30 money leaders of the past PGA Tour season Starting in 2007 it was the final event of the four tournament FedEx Cup Playoffs with eligibility determined by FedEx Cup points accumulated throughout the season From 2019 onward the FedEx Cup was reduced to three events and the Tour Championship is now held in late August rather than mid September While originally followed by the PGA Tour Fall Series for those competing for qualifying exemptions in the following season a re alignment of the PGA Tour s season schedule in 2013 made the Tour Championship the final event of the season From 1987 to 1996 several courses hosted the event Beginning in 1997 the event alternated between Champions Golf Club in Houston and East Lake Golf Club in Atlanta since 2004 East Lake has been the event s permanent home From its debut in 1987 through 2006 the top 30 money winners on the PGA Tour after the penultimate event qualified for the event It took place in early November the week after the comparable event in Europe the Volvo Masters which allowed players who are members of both the PGA Tour and the European Tour to play in both end of season events After the Tour Championship the money list for the season was finalized There were a number of additional events between the Tour Championship and Christmas which were recognized by the PGA Tour but prize money won in them was unofficial Also because this tournament s field was not as large as other golf tournaments there was no 36 hole cut all players who started the event were credited with making the cut and received some prize money In 2007 the Tour Championship moved from November to mid September where it ended the four tournament FedEx Cup Playoffs As in past years 30 players qualified for the event but the basis for qualification was no longer prize money Instead FedEx Cup points accumulated during the regular PGA Tour season and then during the three preceding playoff events determined the participants Beginning in 2009 the assignment and awarding of points assured that if any of the top five FedEx Cup point leaders entering The Tour Championship won the event that player would also won the FedEx Cup Therefore it still remained possible for one player to win the Tour Championship and another player to win the FedEx Cup For example Tiger Woods won the 2018 Tour Championship but finished second in the FedEx Cup while Justin Rose won the FedEx Cup despite finishing the tournament tied for fourth because Woods entered the Tour Championship 20th in overall points while Rose was 2nd 1 2 2007 was also the inaugural year for the Tour s Fall Series which determined the rest of the top 125 players eligible for the following year s FedEx Cup which made the event no longer the final tournament of the season However starting in 2013 the Tour Championship was the final tournament of the PGA Tour season seasons begin in October of the previous calendar year 3 Since 2007 those who qualified for the Tour Championship earned a Masters Tournament invitation For 2020 players who qualify for the Tour Championship will be invited to the Sentry Tournament of Champions a byproduct of tournament cancellations from the coronavirus pandemic Hole 18 at East Lake Golf Club is a par 3 which has been criticized as lacking drama for fans The PGA Tour announced in 2016 that it would be reversing the nines at East Lake for the Tour Championship so that play would finish on a more exciting par 5 hole 4 Beginning in 2019 the tournament adopted a new format in order to ensure that the winner would also be the FedEx Cup champion The player with the most FedEx Cup points leading into the tournament starts at 10 under par The player with the second most points starts at −8 the third at −7 and so on down to the fifth at −5 Players ranked 6 through 10 begin at −4 11 through 15 at −3 and so on down to numbers 26 to 30 who will start at even par 5 6 For purposes of the Official World Golf Ranking only aggregate scores are taken into account disregarding any starting scores in relation to par The Calamity Jane is a sterling silver replica of Bobby Jones s original Calamity Jane putter that has been presented to the winner of the Tour Championship since 2005 In 2017 it was made the official trophy for the tournament 7 8 Each winner before 2005 has been awarded one retrospectively 9 From 1998 to 2018 the Tour Championship winner if not already exempt by other means received a 3 year PGA Tour exemption

https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Allan_Robertson,Golf,,,Allan Robertson 11 September 1815 – 1 September 1859 was considered to be one of the first professional golfers In the mid 19th century golf was played mainly by well off gentlemen as hand crafted clubs and balls were expensive Professionals made a living from playing for bets caddying ball and club making and instruction Robertson was the most famous of these pros Tradition has it that Robertson himself was never beaten as an individual when playing for money He sometimes played at less than his ability in order to minimize the odds he had to give to opponents Robertson is generally regarded as being the best golfer from 1843 onwards 1 even after the arrival of the Park and Morris families Robertson defeated Willie Dunn Sr of Musselburgh who was generally recognized as the top player in a grand challenge match in 1843 the two played 20 rounds over 10 days with Robertson coming out on top 2 Indeed Robertson was the first to score below 80 on the Old Course at St Andrews which he did the year before his death playing a guttie ball Robertson was considered the premier ball and club maker of the time and exported his merchandise all over the world It was a lucrative trade with an ever increasing market The business was originally set up by his grandfather who passed it down to his son before Robertson himself finally inherited it Today a Robertson ball carrying his stamp Allan is highly prized by collectors Old Tom Morris worked from 1835 when he was 14 as an apprentice in Robertson s shop and it is said that the two were never beaten when playing as partners Morris defeated Robertson for the first time in a friendly match in 1843 winning a jacket but the two generally did not compete head to head for stakes Robertson as the acknowledged best player could refuse any challenge according to the custom of the time and said he preferred Morris as his playing partner Morris was in an awkward position with respect to individual playing reputations since he worked for Robertson who eventually fired him after a disagreement over equipment However for many years before that Robertson and Morris had a lucrative playing partnership Musselburgh s young star Willie Park Sr then aged 20 beat Morris head to head over the Old Course in 1853 and then publicly issued a head to head challenge to Robertson which was not taken up Challenge matches usually backed by noblemen and wealthy businessmen were the main form of golf competition at the time 3 Robertson significantly improved the Old Course by enlarging its greens to allow for the increase in golf popularity The out and back flow of play over a narrow strand of fairway at the Old Course eventually led to the establishment of huge double greens virtually unique in Scotland these have occasionally been imitated in modern golf design Robertson s first golf course design work in which he was assisted by Morris was at Carnoustie in 1842 when the two laid out ten new holes 4 Carnoustie gradually evolved into one of the world s best courses The relationship between Robertson and Morris soured when the guttie ball was introduced see golf ball history Robertson caught Morris playing with a guttie and fired him on the spot Robertson attempted to suppress the popularity of the new and cheaper ball which hastened the end of his own 100 year old business making the featherie ball Morris accepted the march of progress and felt obliged to leave Robertson and set up his own workshop Morris moved to Prestwick in 1851 on the west coast of Scotland to build a new golf course where he served as professional and greenkeeper The guttie ball revolutionized golf and Robertson s featherie business did indeed collapse although Robertson quickly moved to manufacture the guttie which was made from liquid rubber gutta percha found in Malaysia Robertson died a few months after an attack of jaundice The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews issued a statement on his death exalting his contribution to golf and organised an annual collection to provide for his widow Robertson s portrait is displayed in the Royal and Ancient Golf Club s gallery His grave is in the churchyard of St Andrews Cathedral just west of the central bell tower It is a sandstone obelisk bearing his sculpted portrait His epitaph reads Allan Robertson who died 1st Sept 1859 aged 44 years old He was greatly esteemed for his personal worth and for many years was distinguished as the champion golfer of Scotland The Open Championship in golf came about as a result of Robertson s death Since he was recognized as the best player during much of his lifetime golfers at Prestwick Golf Club formed a competition in 1860 to decide who would succeed him as the Champion Golfer The Open continuing annually ever since except for war years is the longest running golf championship and the oldest of the four major championships Allan Robertson

https://wikipedia.org/wiki/George_H._W._Bush,Golf,,,George Herbert Walker Bush a June 12 1924 – November 30 2018 was an American politician diplomat and businessman who served as the 41st president of the United States from 1989 to 1993 A member of the Republican Party Bush also served as the 43rd vice president from 1981 to 1989 under Ronald Reagan in the U S House of Representatives as U S Ambassador to the United Nations and as Director of Central Intelligence Bush was raised in Greenwich Connecticut and attended Phillips Academy before serving in the United States Navy Reserve during World War II After the war he graduated from Yale and moved to West Texas where he established a successful oil company After an unsuccessful run for the United States Senate he won the election to the 7th congressional district of Texas in 1966 President Richard Nixon appointed Bush to the position of Ambassador to the United Nations in 1971 and to the position of chairman of the Republican National Committee in 1973 In 1974 President Gerald Ford appointed him as the Chief of the Liaison Office to the People s Republic of China and in 1976 Bush became the Director of Central Intelligence Bush ran for president in 1980 but was defeated in the Republican presidential primaries by Ronald Reagan He was then elected vice president in 1980 and 1984 as Reagan s running mate In the 1988 presidential election Bush defeated Democrat Michael Dukakis becoming the first incumbent vice president to be elected president since Martin Van Buren in 1836 Foreign policy drove the Bush presidency as he navigated the final years of the Cold War and played a key role in the reunification of Germany Bush presided over the invasion of Panama and the Gulf War ending the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait in the latter conflict Though the agreement was not ratified until after he left office Bush negotiated and signed the North American Free Trade Agreement NAFTA which created a trade bloc consisting of the United States Canada and Mexico Domestically Bush reneged on a 1988 campaign promise by signing a bill that increased taxes and helped reduce the federal budget deficit He also signed the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and appointed David Souter and Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court Bush lost the 1992 presidential election to Democrat Bill Clinton following an economic recession and the decreased emphasis of foreign policy in a post–Cold War political climate After leaving office in 1993 Bush was active in humanitarian activities often working alongside Clinton his former opponent With the victory of his son George W Bush in the 2000 presidential election the two became the second father–son pair to serve as the nation s president following John Adams and John Quincy Adams Another son Jeb Bush unsuccessfully sought the Republican presidential nomination in the 2016 Republican primaries Historians generally rank Bush as an above average president George Herbert Walker Bush was born in Milton Massachusetts 2 on June 12 1924 He was the second son of Prescott Bush and Dorothy Walker Bush 3 His paternal grandfather Samuel P Bush worked as an executive for a railroad parts company in Columbus Ohio 4 while his maternal grandfather and namesake George Herbert Walker led Wall Street investment bank W A Harriman Co 5 Walker was known as Pop and young Bush was called Poppy as a tribute to him 6 The Bush family moved to Greenwich Connecticut in 1925 and Prescott took a position with W A Harriman Co which later merged into Brown Brothers Harriman Co the following year 7 Bush spent most of his childhood in Greenwich at the family vacation home in Kennebunkport Maine b or at his maternal grandparents plantation in South Carolina 9 Because of the family s wealth Bush was largely unaffected by the Great Depression 10 He attended Greenwich Country Day School from 1929 to 1937 and Phillips Academy an elite private academy in Massachusetts from 1937 to 1942 11 While at Phillips Academy he served as president of the senior class secretary of the student council president of the community fund raising group a member of the editorial board of the school newspaper and captain of the varsity baseball and soccer teams 12 On his 18th birthday immediately after graduating from Phillips Academy he enlisted in the United States Navy as a naval aviator 13 After a period of training he was commissioned as an ensign in the Naval Reserve at Naval Air Station Corpus Christi on June 9 1943 becoming one of the youngest aviators in the Navy 14 c Beginning in 1944 Bush served in the Pacific theater where he flew a Grumman TBF Avenger a torpedo bomber capable of taking off from aircraft carriers 19 His squadron was assigned to the USS San Jacinto as a member of Air Group 51 where his lanky physique earned him the nickname Skin 20 Bush flew his first combat mission in May 1944 bombing Japanese held Wake Island 21 and was promoted to lieutenant junior grade on August 1 1944 During an attack on a Japanese installation in Chichijima Bush s aircraft successfully attacked several targets but was downed by enemy fire 18 Though both of Bush s fellow crew members died Bush successfully bailed out from the aircraft and was rescued by the USS Finback 22 d Several of the aviators shot down during the attack were captured and executed and their livers were eaten by their captors 23 Bush s survival after such a close brush with death shaped him profoundly leading him to ask Why had I been spared and what did God have for me 24 He was later awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for his role in the mission 25 Bush returned to San Jacinto in November 1944 participating in operations in the Philippines In early 1945 he was assigned to a new combat squadron VT 153 where he trained to take part in an invasion of mainland Japan On September 2 1945 before any invasion took place Japan formally surrendered following the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki 26 Bush was released from active duty that same month but was not formally discharged from the Navy until October 1955 at which point he had reached the rank of lieutenant 18 By the end of his period of active service Bush had flown 58 missions completed 128 carrier landings and recorded 1228 hours of flight time 27 Bush met Barbara Pierce at a Christmas dance in Greenwich in December 1941 28 and after a period of courtship they became engaged in December 1943 29 While Bush was on leave from the Navy they married in Rye New York on January 6 1945 30 The Bushes enjoyed a strong marriage and Barbara would later be a popular First Lady seen by many as a kind of national grandmother 31 e They have six children George W b 1946 Robin 1949 1953 Jeb b 1953 Neil b 1955 Marvin b 1956 and Doro b 1959 13 Their oldest daughter Robin died of leukemia in 1953 34 Bush enrolled at Yale College where he took part in an accelerated program that enabled him to graduate in two and a half years rather than the usual four 13 He was a member of the Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity and was elected its president 35 He also captained the Yale baseball team and played in the first two College World Series as a left handed first baseman 36 Like his father he was a member of the Yale cheerleading squad 37 and was initiated into the Skull and Bones secret society He graduated Phi Beta Kappa in 1948 with a Bachelor of Arts degree majoring in economics and minoring in sociology 38 After graduating from Yale Bush moved his young family to West Texas Biographer Jon Meacham writes that Bush s relocation to Texas allowed him to move out of the daily shadow of his Wall Street father and Grandfather Walker two dominant figures in the financial world but would still allow Bush to call on their connections if he needed to raise capital 39 His first position in Texas was an oil field equipment salesman 40 for Dresser Industries which was led by family friend Neil Mallon 41 While working for Dresser Bush lived in various places with his family Odessa Texas Ventura Bakersfield and Compton California and Midland Texas 42 In 1952 he volunteered for the successful presidential campaign of Republican candidate Dwight D Eisenhower That same year his father won election to represent Connecticut in the United States Senate as a member of the Republican Party 43 With support from Mallon and Bush s uncle George Herbert Walker Jr Bush and John Overbey launched the Bush Overbey Oil Development Company in 1951 44 In 1953 he co founded the Zapata Petroleum Corporation an oil company that drilled in the Permian Basin in Texas 45 In 1954 he was named president of the Zapata Offshore Company a subsidiary which specialized in offshore drilling 46 Shortly after the subsidiary became independent in 1959 Bush moved the company and his family from Midland to Houston 47 There he befriended James Baker a prominent attorney who later became an important political ally 48 Bush remained involved with Zapata until the mid 1960s when he sold his stock in the company for approximately $1 million 49 In 1988 The Nation published an article alleging that Bush worked as an operative of the Central Intelligence Agency CIA during the 1960s Bush denied this allegation 50 By the early 1960s Bush was widely regarded as an appealing political candidate and some leading Democrats attempted to convince Bush to become a Democrat He declined to leave the Republican Party later citing his belief that the national Democratic Party favored big centralized government The Democratic Party had historically dominated Texas but Republicans scored their first major victory in the state with John G Tower s victory in a 1961 special election to the United States Senate Motivated by Tower s victory and hoping to prevent the far right John Birch Society from coming to power Bush ran for the chairmanship of the Harris County Republican Party winning election in February 1963 51 Like most other Texas Republicans Bush supported conservative Senator Barry Goldwater over the more centrist Nelson Rockefeller in the 1964 Republican Party presidential primaries 52 In 1964 Bush sought to unseat liberal Democrat Ralph W Yarborough in Texas s U S Senate election 53 Bolstered by superior fundraising Bush won the Republican primary by defeating former gubernatorial nominee Jack Cox in a run off election In the general election Bush attacked Yarborough s vote for the Civil Rights Act of 1964 which banned racial and gender discrimination in public institutions and in many privately owned businesses Bush argued that the act unconstitutionally expanded the powers of the federal government but he was privately uncomfortable with the racial politics of opposing the act 54 He lost the election 56 percent to 44 percent though he did run well ahead of Goldwater the Republican presidential nominee 53 Despite the loss the New York Times reported that Bush was rated by political friend and foe alike as the Republicans best prospect in Texas because of his attractive personal qualities and the strong campaign he put up for the Senate 55 In 1966 Bush ran for the United States House of Representatives in Texas s 7th congressional district a newly redistricted seat in the Greater Houston area Initial polling showed him trailing his Democratic opponent Harris County District Attorney Frank Briscoe but he ultimately won the race with 57 percent of the vote 56 In an effort to woo potential candidates in the South and Southwest House Republicans secured Bush an appointment to the powerful United States House Committee on Ways and Means making Bush the first freshman to serve on the committee since 1904 57 His voting record in the House was generally conservative He supported the Nixon administration s Vietnam policies but broke with Republicans on the issue of birth control which he supported He also voted for the Civil Rights Act of 1968 although it was generally unpopular in his district 58 59 In 1968 Bush joined several other Republicans in issuing the party s Response to the State of the Union address Bush s part of the address focused on a call for fiscal responsibility 60 Though most other Texas Republicans supported Ronald Reagan in the 1968 Republican Party presidential primaries Bush endorsed Richard Nixon who went on to win the party s nomination Nixon considered selecting Bush as his running mate in the 1968 presidential election but he ultimately chose Spiro Agnew instead Bush won re election to the House unopposed while Nixon defeated Hubert Humphrey in the presidential election 61 In 1970 with President Nixon s support Bush gave up his seat in the House to run for the Senate against Yarborough Bush easily won the Republican primary but Yarborough was defeated by the more conservative Lloyd Bentsen in the Democratic primary 62 Ultimately Bentsen defeated Bush taking 53 5 percent of the vote 63 After the 1970 Senate election Bush accepted a position as a senior adviser to the president but he convinced Nixon to instead appoint him as the U S Ambassador to the United Nations 64 The position represented Bush s first foray into foreign policy as well as his first major experiences with the Soviet Union and China the two major U S rivals in the Cold War 65 During Bush s tenure the Nixon administration pursued a policy of détente seeking to ease tensions with both the Soviet Union and China 66 Bush s ambassadorship was marked by a defeat on the China question as the United Nations General Assembly voted to expel the Republic of China and replace it with the People s Republic of China in October 1971 67 In the 1971 crisis in Pakistan Bush supported an Indian motion at the UN General Assembly to condemn the Pakistani government of Yahya Khan for waging genocide in East Pakistan modern Bangladesh referring to the tradition which we have supported that the human rights question transcended domestic jurisdiction and should be freely debated 68 Bush s support for India at the UN put him into conflict with Nixon who was supporting Pakistan partly because Yahya Khan was a useful intermediary in his attempts to reach out to China and partly because the president was fond of Yahya Khan 69 After Nixon won a landslide victory in the 1972 presidential election he appointed Bush as chair of the Republican National Committee RNC 70 71 In that position he was charged with fundraising candidate recruitment and making appearances on behalf of the party in the media When Agnew was being investigated for corruption Bush assisted at the request of Nixon and Agnew in pressuring John Glenn Beall Jr the U S Senator from Maryland to force his brother George Beall the U S Attorney in Maryland who was supervising the investigation into Agnew Attorney Beall ignored the pressure 72 During Bush s tenure at the RNC the Watergate scandal emerged into public view the scandal originated from the June 1972 break in of the Democratic National Committee but also involved later efforts to cover up the break in by Nixon and other members of the White House 73 Bush initially defended Nixon steadfastly but as Nixon s complicity became clear he focused more on defending the Republican Party 58 Following the resignation of Vice President Agnew in 1973 for a scandal unrelated to Watergate Bush was considered for the position of vice president but the appointment instead went to Gerald Ford 74 After the public release of an audio recording that confirmed that Nixon had plotted to use the CIA to cover up the Watergate break in Bush joined other party leaders in urging Nixon to resign 75 When Nixon resigned on August 9 1974 Bush noted in his diary that There was an aura of sadness like somebody died The resignation speech was vintage Nixon—a kick or two at the press—enormous strains One couldn t help but look at the family and the whole thing and think of his accomplishments and then think of the shame President Gerald Ford s swearing in offered indeed a new spirit a new lift 76 Upon his ascension to the presidency Ford strongly considered Bush Donald Rumsfeld and Nelson Rockefeller for the vacant position of vice president Ford ultimately chose Nelson Rockefeller partly because of the publication of a news report claiming that Bush s 1970 campaign had benefited from a secret fund set up by Nixon Bush was later cleared of any suspicion by a special prosecutor 77 Bush accepted appointment as Chief of the U S Liaison Office in the People s Republic of China making him the de facto ambassador to China 78 According to biographer Jon Meacham Bush s time in China convinced him that American engagement abroad was needed to ensure global stability and that the United States needed to be visible but not pushy muscular but not domineering 79 In January 1976 Ford brought Bush back to Washington to become the Director of Central Intelligence DCI placing him in charge of the CIA 80 In the aftermath of the Watergate scandal and the Vietnam War the CIA s reputation had been damaged for its role in various covert operations and Bush was tasked with restoring the agency s morale and public reputation 81 f During Bush s year in charge of the CIA the U S national security apparatus actively supported Operation Condor operations and right wing military dictatorships in Latin America 82 83 Meanwhile Ford decided to drop Rockefeller from the ticket for the 1976 presidential election he considered Bush as his running mate but ultimately chose Bob Dole 84 In his capacity as DCI Bush gave national security briefings to Jimmy Carter both as a presidential candidate and as president elect 85 Bush s tenure at the CIA ended after Carter narrowly defeated Ford in the 1976 presidential election Out of public office for the first time since the 1960s Bush became chairman on the Executive Committee of the First International Bank in Houston 86 He also spent a year as a part time professor of Administrative Science at Rice University s Jones School of Business 87 continued his membership in the Council on Foreign Relations and joined the Trilateral Commission Meanwhile he began to lay the groundwork for his candidacy in the 1980 Republican Party presidential primaries 88 In the 1980 Republican primary campaign Bush faced Ronald Reagan who was widely regarded as the front runner as well as other contenders like Senator Bob Dole Senator Howard Baker Texas Governor John Connally Congressman Phil Crane and Congressman John B Anderson 89 Bush s campaign cast him as a youthful thinking man s candidate who would emulate the pragmatic conservatism of President Eisenhower 90 In the midst of the Soviet–Afghan War which brought an end to a period of détente and the Iran hostage crisis in which 52 Americans were taken hostage the campaign highlighted Bush s foreign policy experience 91 At the outset of the race Bush focused heavily on winning the January 21 Iowa caucuses making 31 visits to the state 92 He won a close victory in Iowa with 31 5% to Reagan s 29 4% After the win Bush stated that his campaign was full of momentum or the Big Mo 93 and Reagan reorganized his campaign 94 Partly in response to the Bush campaign s frequent questioning of Reagan s age Reagan turned 69 in 1980 the Reagan campaign stepped up attacks on Bush painting him as an elitist who was not truly committed to conservatism 95 Prior to the New Hampshire primary Bush and Reagan agreed to a two person debate organized by The Nashua Telegraph but paid for by the Reagan campaign 94 Days before the debate Reagan announced that he would invite four other candidates to the debate Bush who had hoped that the one on one debate would allow him to emerge as the main alternative to Reagan in the primaries refused to debate the other candidates All six candidates took the stage but Bush refused to speak in the presence of the other candidates Ultimately the other four candidates left the stage and the debate continued but Bush s refusal to debate anyone other than Reagan badly damaged his campaign in New Hampshire 96 He ended up decisively losing New Hampshire s primary to Reagan winning just 23 percent of the vote 94 Bush revitalized his campaign with a victory in Massachusetts but lost the next several primaries As Reagan built up a commanding delegate lead Bush refused to end his campaign but the other candidates dropped out of the race 97 Criticizing his more conservative rival s policy proposals Bush famously labeled Reagan s supply side influenced plans for massive tax cuts as voodoo economics 98 Though he favored lower taxes Bush feared that dramatic reductions in taxation would lead to deficits and in turn cause inflation 99 After Reagan clinched a majority of delegates in late May Bush reluctantly dropped out of the race 100 At the 1980 Republican National Convention Reagan made the last minute decision to select Bush as his vice presidential nominee after negotiations with Ford regarding a Reagan Ford ticket collapsed 101 Though Reagan had resented many of the Bush campaign s attacks during the primary campaign and several conservative leaders had actively opposed Bush s nomination Reagan ultimately decided that Bush s popularity with moderate Republicans made him the best and safest pick Bush who had believed his political career might be over following the primaries eagerly accepted the position and threw himself into campaigning for the Reagan Bush ticket 102 The 1980 general election campaign between Reagan and Carter was conducted amid a multitude of domestic concerns and the ongoing Iran hostage crisis and Reagan sought to focus the race on Carter s handling of the economy 103 Though the race was widely regarded as a close contest for most of the campaign Reagan ultimately won over the large majority of undecided voters 104 Reagan took 50 7 percent of the popular vote and 489 of the 538 electoral votes while Carter won 41% of the popular vote and John Anderson running as an independent candidate won 6 6% of the popular vote 105 As vice president Bush generally maintained a low profile recognizing the constitutional limits of the office he avoided decision making or criticizing Reagan in any way This approach helped him earn Reagan s trust easing tensions left over from their earlier rivalry 94 Bush also generally enjoyed a good relationship with Reagan staffers including his close friend Jim Baker who served as Reagan s initial chief of staff 106 His understanding of the vice presidency was heavily influenced by Vice President Walter Mondale who enjoyed a strong relationship with President Carter in part because of his ability to avoid confrontations with senior staff and Cabinet members and by Vice President Nelson Rockefeller s difficult relationship with some members of the White House staff during the Ford administration 107 The Bushes attended a large number of public and ceremonial events in their positions including many state funerals which became a common joke for comedians As the President of the Senate Bush also stayed in contact with members of Congress and kept the president informed on occurrences on Capitol Hill 94 On March 30 1981 while Bush was in Texas Reagan was shot and seriously wounded by John Hinckley Jr Bush immediately flew back to Washington D C when his plane landed his aides advised him to proceed directly to the White House by helicopter in order to show that the government was still functioning 94 Bush rejected the idea as he feared that such a dramatic scene risked giving the impression that he sought to usurp Reagan s powers and prerogatives 108 During Reagan s short period of incapacity Bush presided over Cabinet meetings met with congressional leaders and foreign leaders and briefed reporters but he consistently rejected the possibility of invoking the Twenty fifth Amendment 109 Bush s handling of the attempted assassination and its aftermath made a positive impression on Reagan who recovered and returned to work within two weeks of the shooting From then on the two men would have regular Thursday lunches in the Oval Office 110 Bush was assigned by Reagan to chair two special task forces one on deregulation and one on international drug smuggling Both were popular issues with conservatives and Bush largely a moderate began courting them through his work The deregulation task force reviewed hundreds of rules making specific recommendations on which ones to amend or revise in order to curb the size of the federal government 94 The Reagan administration s deregulation push had a strong impact on broadcasting finance resource extraction and other economic activities and the administration eliminated numerous government positions 111 Bush also oversaw the administration s national security crisis management organization which had traditionally been the responsibility of the National Security Advisor 112 In 1983 Bush toured Western Europe as part of the Reagan administration s ultimately successful efforts to convince skeptical NATO allies to support the deployment of Pershing II missiles 113 Reagan s approval ratings fell after his first year in office but they bounced back when the United States began to emerge from recession in 1983 114 Former Vice President Walter Mondale was nominated by the Democratic Party in the 1984 presidential election Down in the polls Mondale selected Congresswoman Geraldine Ferraro as his running mate in hopes of galvanizing support for his campaign thus making Ferraro the first female major party vice presidential nominee in U S history 115 She and Bush squared off in a single televised vice presidential debate 94 Public opinion polling consistently showed a Reagan lead in the 1984 campaign and Mondale was unable to shake up the race 116 In the end Reagan won re election winning 49 of 50 states and receiving 59% of the popular vote to Mondale s 41% 117 Mikhail Gorbachev came to power in the Soviet Union in 1985 Rejecting the ideologically rigidity of his three elderly sick predecessors Gorbachev insisted on urgently needed economic and political reforms called glasnost openness and perestroika restructuring 118 At the 1987 Washington Summit Gorbachev and Reagan signed the Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces Treaty which committed both signatories to the total abolition of their respective short range and medium range missile stockpiles 119 The treaty marked the beginning of a new era of trade openness and cooperation between the two powers 120 President Reagan and Secretary of State George Shultz took the lead in these negotiations but Bush sat in on many meetings Bush did not agree with many of the Reagan policies but he did tell Gorbachev that he would seek to continue improving relations if he succeeded Reagan 121 122 On July 13 1985 Bush became the first vice president to serve as acting president when Reagan underwent surgery to remove polyps from his colon Bush served as the acting president for approximately eight hours 123 In 1986 the Reagan administration was shaken by a scandal when it was revealed that administration officials had secretly arranged weapon sales to Iran during the Iran–Iraq War The officials had used the proceeds to fund the anti communist Contras in Nicaragua Democrats had passed a law that appropriated funds could not be used to help the Contras Instead the administration used non appropriated funds from the sales 94 When news of affair broke to the media Bush stated that he had been out of the loop and unaware of the diversion of funds 124 Biographer Jon Meacham writes that no evidence was ever produced proving Bush was aware of the diversion to the contras but he criticizes Bush s out of the loop characterization writing that the record is clear that Bush was aware that the United States in contravention of its own stated policy was trading arms for hostages 125 The Iran–Contra scandal as it became known did serious damage to the Reagan presidency raising questions about Reagan s competency 126 Congress established the Tower Commission to investigate the scandal and at Reagan s request a panel of federal judges appointed Lawrence Walsh as a special prosecutor charged with investigating the Iran–Contra scandal 127 The investigations continued after Reagan left office and though Bush was never charged with a crime the Iran–Contra scandal would remain a political liability for him 128 Bush began planning for a presidential run after the 1984 election and he officially entered the 1988 Republican Party presidential primaries in October 1987 94 He put together a campaign led by Reagan staffer Lee Atwater and which also included his son George W Bush and media consultant Roger Ailes 129 Though he had moved to the right during his time as vice president endorsing a Human Life Amendment and repudiating his earlier comments on voodoo economics Bush still faced opposition from many conservatives in the Republican Party 130 His major rivals for the Republican nomination were Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole of Kansas Congressman Jack Kemp of New York and Christian televangelist Pat Robertson 131 Reagan did not publicly endorse any candidate but he privately expressed support for Bush 132 Though considered the early front runner for the nomination Bush came in third in the Iowa caucus behind Dole and Robertson 133 Much as Reagan had done in 1980 Bush reorganized his staff and concentrated on the New Hampshire primary 94 With help from Governor John H Sununu and an effective campaign attacking Dole for raising taxes Bush overcame an initial polling deficit and won New Hampshire with 39 percent of the vote 134 After Bush won South Carolina and 16 of the 17 states holding a primary on Super Tuesday his competitors dropped out of the race 135 Bush occasionally criticized for his lack of eloquence when compared to Reagan delivered a well received speech at the Republican convention Known as the thousand points of light speech it described Bush s vision of America he endorsed the Pledge of Allegiance prayer in schools capital punishment and gun rights 136 Bush also pledged that he would not raise taxes stating Congress will push me to raise taxes and I ll say no and they ll push and I ll say no and they ll push again And all I can say to them is read my lips No new taxes 137 Bush selected little known Senator Dan Quayle of Indiana as his running mate Though Quayle had compiled an unremarkable record in Congress he was popular among many conservatives and the campaign hoped that Quayle s youth would appeal to younger voters 138 Meanwhile the Democratic Party nominated Governor Michael Dukakis who was known for presiding over an economic turnaround in Massachusetts 139 Leading in the general election polls against Bush Dukakis ran an ineffective low risk campaign 140 The Bush campaign attacked Dukakis as an unpatriotic liberal extremist and seized on the Willie Horton case in which a convicted felon from Massachusetts raped a woman while on a prison furlough a program Dukakis supported as governor The Bush campaign charged that Dukakis presided over a revolving door that allowed dangerous convicted felons to leave prison 141 Dukakis damaged his own campaign with a widely mocked ride in an M1 Abrams tank and a poor performance at the second presidential debate 142 Bush also attacked Dukakis for opposing a law that would require all students to recite the Pledge of Allegiance 136 The election is widely considered to have had a high level of negative campaigning though political scientist John Geer has argued that the share of negative ads was in line with previous presidential elections 143 Bush defeated Dukakis by a margin of 426 to 111 in the Electoral College and he took 53 4 percent of the national popular vote 144 Bush ran well in all the major regions of the country but especially in the South 145 He became the first sitting vice president to be elected president since Martin Van Buren in 1836 and the first person to succeed a president from his own party via election since Herbert Hoover in 1929 94 g In the concurrent congressional elections Democrats retained control of both houses of Congress 147 Bush was inaugurated on January 20 1989 succeeding Ronald Reagan In his inaugural address Bush said I come before you and assume the Presidency at a moment rich with promise We live in a peaceful prosperous time but we can make it better For a new breeze is blowing and a world refreshed by freedom seems reborn for in man s heart if not in fact the day of the dictator is over The totalitarian era is passing its old ideas blown away like leaves from an ancient lifeless tree A new breeze is blowing and a nation refreshed by freedom stands ready to push on There is new ground to be broken and new action to be taken 148 Bush s first major appointment was that of James Baker as Secretary of State 149 Leadership of the Department of Defense went to Dick Cheney who had previously served as Gerald Ford s chief of staff and would later serve as vice president under his son George W Bush 150 Jack Kemp joined the administration as Secretary of Housing and Urban Development while Elizabeth Dole the wife of Bob Dole and a former Secretary of Transportation became the Secretary of Labor under Bush 151 Bush retained several Reagan officials including Secretary of the Treasury Nicholas F Brady Attorney General Dick Thornburgh and Secretary of Education Lauro Cavazos 152 New Hampshire Governor John Sununu a strong supporter of Bush during the 1988 campaign became chief of staff 149 Brent Scowcroft was appointed as the National Security Advisor a role he had also held under Ford 153 During the first year of his tenure Bush put a pause on Reagan s détente policy toward the USSR 154 Bush and his advisers were initially divided on Gorbachev some administration officials saw him as a democratic reformer but others suspected him of trying to make the minimum changes necessary to restore the Soviet Union to a competitive position with the United States 155 In 1989 all the Communist governments collapsed in Eastern Europe Gorbachev declined to send in the Soviet military effectively abandoning the Brezhnev Doctrine The U S was not directly involved in these upheavals but the Bush administration avoided gloating over the demise of the Eastern Bloc to avoid undermining further democratic reforms 156 Bush and Gorbachev met at the Malta Summit in December 1989 Though many on the right remained wary of Gorbachev Bush came away with the belief that Gorbachev would negotiate in good faith 157 For the remainder of his term Bush sought cooperative relations with Gorbachev believing that he was the key to peace 158 The primary issue at the Malta Summit was the potential reunification of Germany While Britain and France were wary of a re unified Germany Bush joined West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl in pushing for German reunification 159 Bush believed that a reunified Germany would serve American interests 160 After extensive negotiations Gorbachev agreed to allow a reunified Germany to be a part of NATO and Germany officially reunified in October 1990 after paying billions of marks to Moscow 161 Gorbachev used force to suppress nationalist movements within the Soviet Union itself 162 A crisis in Lithuania left Bush in a difficult position as he needed Gorbachev s cooperation in the reunification of Germany and feared that the collapse of the Soviet Union could leave nuclear arms in dangerous hands The Bush administration mildly protested Gorbachev s suppression of Lithuania s independence movement but took no action to directly intervene 163 Bush warned independence movements of the disorder that could come with secession from the Soviet Union in a 1991 address that critics labeled the Chicken Kiev speech he cautioned against suicidal nationalism 164 In July 1991 Bush and Gorbachev signed the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty START I treaty in which both countries agreed to cut their strategic nuclear weapons by 30 percent 165 In August 1991 hard line Communists launched a coup against Gorbachev while the coup quickly fell apart it broke the remaining power of Gorbachev and the central Soviet government 166 Later that month Gorbachev resigned as general secretary of the Communist party and Russian president Boris Yeltsin ordered the seizure of Soviet property Gorbachev clung to power as the President of the Soviet Union until December 1991 when the Soviet Union dissolved 167 Fifteen states emerged from the Soviet Union and of those states Russia was the largest and most populous Bush and Yeltsin met in February 1992 declaring a new era of friendship and partnership 168 In January 1993 Bush and Yeltsin agreed to START II which provided for further nuclear arms reductions on top of the original START treaty 169 The collapse of the Soviet Union prompted reflections on the future of the world following the end of the Cold War one political scientist Francis Fukuyama speculated that humanity had reached the end of history in that liberal capitalist democracy had permanently triumphed over Communism and fascism 170 Meanwhile the collapse of the Soviet Union and other Communist governments led to post Soviet conflicts in Central Europe Eastern Europe Central Asia and Africa that would continue long after Bush left office 171 During the 1980s the U S had provided aid to Panamanian leader Manuel Noriega an anti Communist dictator who engaged in drug trafficking In May 1989 Noriega annulled the results of a democratic presidential election in which Guillermo Endara had been elected Bush objected to the annulment of the election and worried about the status of the Panama Canal with Noriega still in office 172 Bush dispatched 2 000 soldiers to the country where they began conducting regular military exercises in violation of prior treaties 173 After a U S serviceman was shot by Panamanian forces in December 1989 Bush ordered the United States invasion of Panama known as Operation Just Cause The invasion was the first large scale American military operation in more than 40 years that was not related to the Cold War American forces quickly took control of the Panama Canal Zone and Panama City Noriega surrendered on January 3 1990 and was quickly transported to a prison in the United States Twenty three Americans died in the operation while another 394 were wounded Noriega was convicted and imprisoned on racketeering and drug trafficking charges in April 1992 172 Historian Stewart Brewer argues that the invasion represented a new era in American foreign policy because Bush did not justify the invasion under the Monroe Doctrine or the threat of Communism but rather on the grounds that it was in the best interests of the United States 174 Faced with massive debts and low oil prices in the aftermath of the Iran–Iraq War Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein decided to conquer the country of Kuwait a small oil rich country situated on Iraq s southern border 175 After Iraq invaded Kuwait in August 1990 Bush imposed economic sanctions on Iraq and assembled a multi national coalition opposed to the invasion 176 The administration feared that a failure to respond to the invasion would embolden Hussein to attack Saudi Arabia or Israel and wanted to discourage other countries from similar aggression 177 Bush also wanted to ensure continued access to oil as Iraq and Kuwait collectively accounted for 20 percent of the world s oil production and Saudi Arabia produced another 26 percent of the world s oil supply 178 At Bush s insistence in November 1990 the United Nations Security Council approved a resolution authorizing the use of force if Iraq did not withdrawal from Kuwait by January 15 1991 179 Gorbachev s support as well as China s abstention helped ensure passage of the UN resolution 180 Bush convinced Britain France and other nations to commit soldiers to an operation against Iraq and he won important financial backing from Germany Japan South Korea Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates 181 In January 1991 Bush asked Congress to approve a joint resolution authorizing a war against Iraq 182 Bush believed that the UN resolution had already provided him with the necessary authorization to launch a military operation against Iraq but he wanted to show that the nation was united behind a military action 183 Despite the opposition of a majority of Democrats in both the House and the Senate Congress approved the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution of 1991 182 After the January 15 deadline passed without an Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait U S and coalition forces began a conducted a bombing campaign that devastated Iraq s power grid and communications network and resulted in the desertion of about 100 000 Iraqi soldiers In retaliation Iraq launched Scud missiles at Israel and Saudi Arabia but most of the missiles did little damage On February 23 coalition forces began a ground invasion into Kuwait evicting Iraqi forces by the end of February 27 About 300 Americans as well as approximately 65 soldiers from other coalition nations died during the military action 184 A cease fire was arranged on March 3 and the UN passed a resolution establishing a peacekeeping force in a demilitarized zone between Kuwait and Iraq 185 A March 1991 Gallup poll showed that Bush had an approval rating of 89 percent the highest presidential approval rating in the history of Gallup polling 186 After 1991 the UN maintained economic sanctions against Iraq and the United Nations Special Commission was assigned to ensure that Iraq did not revive its weapons of mass destruction program 187 In 1987 the U S and Canada had reached a free trade agreement that eliminated many tariffs between the two countries President Reagan had intended it as the first step towards a larger trade agreement to eliminate most tariffs among the United States Canada and Mexico 188 The Bush administration along with the Progressive Conservative Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney spearheaded the negotiations of the North American Free Trade Agreement NAFTA with Mexico In addition to lowering tariffs the proposed treaty would affected patents copyrights and trademarks 189 In 1991 Bush sought fast track authority which grants the president the power to submit an international trade agreement to Congress without the possibility of amendment Despite congressional opposition led by House Majority Leader Dick Gephardt both houses of Congress voted to grant Bush fast track authority NAFTA was signed in December 1992 after Bush lost re election 190 but President Clinton won ratification of NAFTA in 1993 191 NAFTA remains controversial for its impact on wages jobs and overall economic growth 192 The U S economy had generally performed well since emerging from recession in late 1982 but it slipped into a mild recession in 1990 The unemployment rate rose from 5 9 percent in 1989 to a high of 7 8 percent in mid 1991 193 194 Large federal deficits spawned during the Reagan years rose from $152 1 billion in 1989 195 to $220 billion for 1990 196 the $220 billion deficit represented a threefold increase since 1980 197 As the public became increasingly concerned about the economy and other domestic affairs Bush s well received handling of foreign affairs became less of an issue for most voters 198 Bush s top domestic priority was to bring an end to federal budget deficits which he saw as a liability for the country s long term economic health and standing in the world 199 As he was opposed to major defense spending cuts 200 and had pledged to not raise taxes the president had major difficulties in balancing the budget 201 Bush and congressional leaders agreed to avoid major changes to the budget for fiscal year 1990 which began in October 1989 However both sides knew that spending cuts or new taxes would be necessary in the following year s budget in order to avoid the draconian automatic domestic spending cuts required by the Gramm–Rudman–Hollings Balanced Budget Act of 1987 202 Bush and other leaders also wanted to cut deficits because Federal Reserve Chair Alan Greenspan refused to lower interest rates and thus stimulate economic growth unless the federal budget deficit was reduced 203 In a statement released in late June 1990 Bush said that he would be open to a deficit reduction program which included spending cuts incentives for economic growth budget process reform as well as tax increases 204 To fiscal conservatives in the Republican Party Bush s statement represented a betrayal and they heavily criticized him for compromising so early in the negotiations 205 In September 1990 Bush and Congressional Democrats announced a compromise to cut funding for mandatory and discretionary programs while also raising revenue partly through a higher gas tax The compromise additionally included a pay as you go provision that required that new programs be paid for at the time of implementation 206 House Minority Whip Newt Gingrich led the conservative opposition to the bill strongly opposing any form of tax increase 207 Some liberals also criticized the budget cuts in the compromise and in October the House rejected the deal resulting in a brief government shutdown Without the strong backing of the Republican Party Bush agreed to another compromise bill this one more favorable to Democrats The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 OBRA 90 enacted on October 27 1990 dropped much of the gasoline tax increase in favor of higher income taxes on top earners It included cuts to domestic spending but the cuts were not as deep as those that had been proposed in the original compromise Bush s decision to sign the bill damaged his standing with conservatives and the general public but it also laid the groundwork for the budget surpluses of the late 1990s 208 Bush s remarks at the signing ceremony for the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 209 The disabled had not received legal protections under the landmark Civil Rights Act of 1964 and many faced discrimination and segregation by the time Bush took office In 1988 Lowell P Weicker Jr and Tony Coelho had introduced the Americans with Disabilities Act which barred employment discrimination against qualified individuals with disabilities The bill had passed the Senate but not the House and it was reintroduced in 1989 Though some conservatives opposed the bill due to its costs and potential burdens on businesses Bush strongly supported it partly because his son Neil had struggled with dyslexia After the bill passed both houses of Congress Bush signed the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 into law in July 1990 210 The act required employers and public accommodations to make reasonable accommodations for the disabled while providing an exception when such accommodations imposed an undue hardship 211 Senator Ted Kennedy later led the congressional passage of a separate civil rights bill designed to facilitate launching employment discrimination lawsuits 212 In vetoing the bill Bush argued that it would lead to racial quotas in hiring 213 214 In November 1991 Bush signed the Civil Rights Act of 1991 which was largely similar to the bill he had vetoed in the previous year 212 In August 1990 Bush signed the Ryan White CARE Act the largest federally funded program dedicated to assisting persons living with HIV AIDS 215 Throughout his presidency the AIDS epidemic grew dramatically in the U S and around the world and Bush often found himself at odds with AIDS activist groups who criticized him for not placing a high priority on HIV AIDS research and funding Frustrated by the administration s lack of urgency on the issue ACT UP dumped the ashes of HIV AIDS victims on the White House lawn during a viewing of the AIDS Quilt in 1992 216 By that time HIV had become the leading cause of death in the U S for men aged 25–44 217 In June 1989 the Bush administration proposed a bill to amend the Clean Air Act Working with Senate Majority Leader George J Mitchell the administration won passage of the amendments over the opposition of business aligned members of Congress who feared the impact of tougher regulations 218 The legislation sought to curb acid rain and smog by requiring decreased emissions of chemicals such as sulfur dioxide 219 and was the first major update to the Clean Air Act since 1977 220 Bush also signed the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 in response to the Exxon Valdez oil spill However the League of Conservation Voters criticized some of Bush s other environmental actions including his opposition to stricter auto mileage standards 221 President Bush devoted attention to voluntary service as a means of solving some of America s most serious social problems He often used the thousand points of light theme to describe the power of citizens to solve community problems In his 1989 inaugural address President Bush said I have spoken of a thousand points of light of all the community organizations that are spread like stars throughout the Nation doing good 222 During his presidency Bush honored numerous volunteers with the Daily Point of Light Award a tradition that was continued by his presidential successors 223 In 1990 the Points of Light Foundation was created as a nonprofit organization in Washington to promote this spirit of volunteerism 224 In 2007 the Points of Light Foundation merged with the Hands On Network to create a new organization Points of Light 225 Bush appointed two justices to the Supreme Court of the United States In 1990 Bush appointed a largely unknown state appellate judge David Souter to replace liberal icon William Brennan 226 Souter was easily confirmed and served until 2009 but joined the liberal bloc of the court disappointing Bush 226 In 1991 Bush nominated conservative federal judge Clarence Thomas to succeed Thurgood Marshall a long time liberal stalwart Thomas the former head of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission EEOC faced heavy opposition in the Senate as well as from pro choice groups and the NAACP His nomination faced another difficulty when Anita Hill accused Thomas of having sexually harassed her during his time as the chair of EEOC Thomas won confirmation in a narrow 52–48 vote 43 Republicans and 9 Democrats voted to confirm Thomas s nomination while 46 Democrats and 2 Republicans voted against confirmation 227 Thomas became one of the most conservative justices of his era 228 Bush s education platform consisted mainly of offering federal support for a variety of innovations such as open enrollment incentive pay for outstanding teachers and rewards for schools that improve performance with underprivileged children 229 Though Bush did not pass a major educational reform package during his presidency his ideas influenced later reform efforts including Goals 2000 and the No Child Left Behind Act 230 Bush signed the Immigration Act of 1990 231 which led to a 40 percent increase in legal immigration to the United States 232 The act more than doubled the number of visas given to immigrants on the basis of job skills 233 In the wake of the savings and loan crisis Bush proposed a $50 billion package to rescue the savings and loans industry and also proposed the creation of the Office of Thrift Supervision to regulate the industry Congress passed the Financial Institutions Reform Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 which incorporated most of Bush s proposals 234 Bush was widely seen as a pragmatic caretaker president who lacked a unified and compelling long term theme in his efforts 235 236 237 Indeed Bush s sound bite where he refers to the issue of overarching purpose as the vision thing has become a metonym applied to other political figures accused of similar difficulties 238 239 240 241 242 243 His ability to gain broad international support for the Gulf War and the war s result were seen as both a diplomatic and military triumph 244 rousing bipartisan approval 245 though his decision to withdraw without removing Saddam Hussein left mixed feelings and attention returned to the domestic front and a souring economy 246 A New York Times article mistakenly depicted Bush as being surprised to see a supermarket barcode reader 247 248 the report of his reaction exacerbated the notion that he was out of touch 247 Amid the early 1990s recession his image shifted from conquering hero to politician befuddled by economic matters 249 At the elite level a number of commentators and political experts deplored the state of American politics in 1991–1992 and reported the voters were angry Many analysts blamed the poor quality of national election campaigns 250 Bush announced his reelection bid in early 1992 with a coalition victory in the Persian Gulf War and high approval ratings Bush s reelection initially looked likely 251 As a result many leading Democrats including Mario Cuomo Dick Gephardt and Al Gore declined to seek their party s presidential nomination 252 However Bush s tax increase had angered many conservatives who believed that Bush had strayed from the conservative principles of Ronald Reagan 253 He faced a challenge from conservative political columnist Pat Buchanan in the 1992 Republican primaries 254 Bush fended off Buchanan s challenge and won his party s nomination at the 1992 Republican National Convention but the convention adopted a socially conservative platform strongly influenced by the Christian right 255 Meanwhile the Democrats nominated Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas A moderate who was affiliated with the Democratic Leadership Council DLC Clinton favored welfare reform deficit reduction and a tax cut for the middle class 256 In early 1992 the race took an unexpected twist when Texas billionaire H Ross Perot launched a third party bid claiming that neither Republicans nor Democrats could eliminate the deficit and make government more efficient His message appealed to voters across the political spectrum disappointed with both parties perceived fiscal irresponsibility 257 Perot also attacked NAFTA which he claimed would lead to major job losses 258 National polling taken in mid 1992 showed Perot in the lead but Clinton experienced a surge through effective campaigning and the selection of Senator Al Gore a popular and relatively young Southerner as his running mate 259 Clinton won the election taking 43 percent of the popular vote and 370 electoral votes while Bush won 37 5 percent of the popular vote and 168 electoral votes 260 Perot won 19% of the popular vote one of the highest totals for a third party candidate in U S history drawing equally from both major candidates according to exit polls 261 Clinton performed well in the Northeast the Midwest and the West Coast while also waging the strongest Democratic campaign in the South since the 1976 election 262 Several factors were important in Bush s defeat The ailing economy which arose from recession may have been the main factor in Bush s loss as 7 in 10 voters said on election day that the economy was either not so good or poor 263 264 On the eve of the 1992 election the unemployment rate stood at 7 8% which was the highest it had been since 1984 265 The president was also damaged by his alienation of many conservatives in his party 266 Bush blamed Perot in part for his defeat though exit polls showed that Perot drew his voters about equally from Clinton and Bush 267 Despite his defeat Bush left office with a 56 percent job approval rating in January 1993 268 Like many of his predecessors Bush issued a series of pardons during his last days in office In December 1992 he granted executive clemency to six former senior government officials implicated in the Iran Contra scandal most prominently former Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger 269 The charges against the six were that they lied to or withheld information from Congress The pardons effectively brought an end to the Iran Contra scandal 270 According to Seymour Martin Lipset the 1992 election had several unique characteristics Voters felt that economic conditions were worse than they actually were which harmed Bush A rare event was the a strong third party candidate Liberals launched a backlash against 12 years of a conservative White House The chief factor was Clinton s uniting his party and winning over a number of heterogeneous groups 271 After leaving office Bush and his wife built a retirement house in the community of West Oaks Houston 272 He established a presidential office within the Park Laureate Building on Memorial Drive in Houston 273 He also frequently spent time at his vacation home in Kennebunkport took annual cruises in Greece went on fishing trips in Florida and visited the Bohemian Club in Northern California He declined to serve on corporate boards but delivered numerous paid speeches and served as an adviser to The Carlyle Group a private equity firm 274 He never published his memoirs but he and Brent Scowcroft co wrote A World Transformed a 1999 work on foreign policy Portions of his letters and his diary were later published as The China Diary of George H W Bush and All The Best George Bush 275 During a 1993 visit to Kuwait Bush was targeted in an assassination plot directed by the Iraqi Intelligence Service President Clinton retaliated when he ordered the firing of 23 cruise missiles at Iraqi Intelligence Service headquarters in Baghdad 276 Bush did not publicly comment on the assassination attempt or the missile strike but privately spoke with Clinton shortly before the strike took place 277 In the 1994 gubernatorial elections his sons George W and Jeb concurrently ran for Governor of Texas and Governor of Florida Concerning their political careers he advised them both that a t some point both of you may want to say Well I don t agree with my Dad on that point or Frankly I think Dad was wrong on that Do it Chart your own course not just on the issues but on defining yourselves 278 George W won his race against Ann Richards while Jeb lost to Lawton Chiles After the results came in the elder Bush told ABC I have very mixed emotions Proud father is the way I would sum it all up 279 Jeb would again run for governor of Florida in 1998 and win at the same time that his brother George W won re election in Texas It marked the second time in United States history that a pair of brothers served simultaneously as governors 280 Bush supported his son s candidacy in the 2000 presidential election but did not actively campaign in the election and did not deliver a speech at the 2000 Republican National Convention 281 George W Bush defeated Al Gore in the 2000 election and was re elected in 2004 Bush and his son thus became the second father–son pair to each serve as President of the United States following John Adams and John Quincy Adams 282 Through previous administrations the elder Bush had ubiquitously been known as George Bush or President Bush but following his son s election the need to distinguish between them has made retronymic forms such as George H W Bush and George Bush Sr and colloquialisms such as Bush 41 and Bush the Elder more common 283 Bush advised his son on some personnel choices approving of the selection of Dick Cheney as running mate and the retention of George Tenet as CIA Director However he was not consulted on all appointments including that of his old rival Donald Rumsfeld as Secretary of Defense 284 Though he avoided giving unsolicited advice to his son Bush and his son also discussed some matters of policy especially regarding national security issues 285 In his retirement Bush generally avoided publicly expressing his opinion on political issues instead using the public spotlight to support various charities 286 Despite earlier political differences with Bill Clinton the two former presidents eventually became friends 287 They appeared together in television ads encouraging aid for victims of Hurricane Katrina and the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami 288 Bush supported Republican John McCain in the 2008 presidential election 289 and Republican Mitt Romney in the 2012 presidential election 290 but both were defeated by Democrat Barack Obama In 2011 Obama awarded Bush with the Presidential Medal of Freedom the highest civilian honor in the United States 291 Bush supported his son Jeb s bid in the 2016 Republican primaries 292 Jeb Bush s campaign struggled however and he withdrew from the race during the primaries Neither George H W nor George W Bush endorsed the eventual Republican nominee Donald Trump 293 all three Bushes emerged as frequent critics of Trump s policies and speaking style while Trump frequently criticized George W Bush s presidency George H W Bush later said that he voted for the Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in the general election 294 After the election Bush wrote a letter to president elect Donald Trump in January 2017 to inform him that because of his poor health he would not be able to attend Trump s inauguration on January 20 he gave him his best wishes 295 In August 2017 after the violence at Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville both Presidents Bush released a joint statement saying America must always reject racial bigotry anti Semitism and hatred in all forms As we pray for Charlottesville we are all reminded of the fundamental truths recorded by that city s most prominent citizen in the Declaration of Independence we are all created equal and endowed by our Creator with unalienable rights 296 297 On April 17 2018 Barbara Bush died at the age of 92 298 at her home in Houston Texas Her funeral was held at St Martin s Episcopal Church in Houston four days later 299 300 Bush along with former Presidents Barack Obama George W Bush son Bill Clinton and fellow First Ladies Melania Trump Michelle Obama Laura Bush daughter in law and Hillary Clinton were representatives who attended the funeral and who took a photo together after the service as a sign of unity which went viral online 301 302 On November 1 Bush went to the polls to vote early in the midterm elections This would be his final public appearance 303 After a long battle with vascular Parkinson s disease Bush died at his home in Houston on November 30 2018 at the age of 94 304 305 At the time of his death he was the longest lived U S president 306 a distinction now held by Jimmy Carter 307 He was also the third oldest vice president h Bush lay in state in the Rotunda of the U S Capitol from December 3 through December 5 he was the 12th U S president to be accorded this honor 309 310 Then on December 5 Bush s casket was transferred from the Capitol rotunda to Washington National Cathedral where a state funeral was held 311 After the funeral Bush s body was transported to George H W Bush Presidential Library in College Station Texas where he was buried next to his wife Barbara and daughter Robin 312 At the funeral former president George W Bush eulogized his father saying He looked for the good in each person and he usually found it 311 In 1991 The New York Times revealed that Bush was suffering from Graves disease a non contagious thyroid condition that his wife Barbara also suffered from 313 Later in life Bush suffered from vascular parkinsonism a form of Parkinson s disease which forced him to use a motorized scooter or wheelchair 314 Bush was a lifelong Episcopalian 315 He cited various moments in his life deepening of his faith including his escape from Japanese forces in 1944 and the death of his three year old daughter Robin in 1953 316 His faith was reflected in his Thousand Points of Light speech his support for prayer in schools and his support for the pro life movement following his election as vice president 315 316 Polls of historians and political scientists have ranked Bush in the top half of presidents A 2018 poll of the American Political Science Association s Presidents and Executive Politics section ranked Bush as the 17th best president out of 44 317 A 2017 C Span poll of historians also ranked Bush as the 20th best president out of 43 318 Richard Rose described Bush as a guardian president and many other historians and political scientists have similarly described Bush as a passive hands off president who was largely content with things as they were 319 Professor Steven Knott writes that g enerally the Bush presidency is viewed as successful in foreign affairs but a disappointment in domestic affairs 320 Biographer Jon Meacham writes that after he left office many Americans viewed Bush as a gracious and underappreciated man who had many virtues but who had failed to project enough of a distinctive identity and vision to overcome the economic challenges of 1991–92 and to win a second term 321 Bush himself noted that his legacy was lost between the glory of Reagan and the trials and tribulations of my sons 322 In the 2010s Bush was fondly remembered for his willingness to compromise which contrasted with the intensely partisan era that followed his presidency 323 In 2018 Vox highlighted Bush for his pragmatism as a moderate Republican president by working across the aisle 324 They specifically noted Bush s accomplishments within the domestic policy by making bipartisan deals including raising with tax budget among the wealthy with the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 Bush also helped pass the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 which The New York Times described as the most sweeping anti discrimination law since the Civil Rights Act of 1964 325 In response to the Exxon Valdez oil spill Bush built another bipartisan coalition to strengthen the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 326 327 Bush also championed and signed into a law the Immigration Act of 1990 a sweeping bipartisan immigration reform act that made it easier for immigrants to legally enter the county while also granting immigrants fleeing violence the temporary protected status visa as well as lifted the pre naturalization English testing process and finally eliminated the exclusion of homosexuals under what Congress now deemed the medically unsound classification of sexual deviant that was included in the 1965 act 328 329 Bush stated Immigration is not just a link to our past but its also a bridge to America s future 330 According to USA Today the legacy of Bush s presidency was defined by his victory over Iraq after the invasion of Kuwait and for his presiding over the Dissolution of the Soviet Union and the German reunification 331 Michael Beschloss and Strobe Talbott praise Bush s handling of the USSR especially how he prodded Gorbachev in terms of releasing control over the satellite states and permitting German unification—and especially a united Germany in NATO 332 Andrew Bacevich judges the Bush administration as morally obtuse in the light of its business as usual attitude towards China after the massacre in Tiananmen Square and its uncritical support of Gorbachev as the Soviet Union disintegrated 333 David Rothkopf argues In 1990 Time magazine named him the Man of the Year 335 In 1997 the Houston Intercontinental Airport was renamed as the George Bush Intercontinental Airport 336 In 1999 the CIA headquarters in Langley Virginia was named the George Bush Center for Intelligence in his honor 337 In 2011 Bush an avid golfer was inducted in the World Golf Hall of Fame 338 The USS George H W Bush CVN 77 the tenth and last Nimitz class supercarrier of the United States Navy was named for Bush 339

https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_Strong_(golfer),Golf,,,Herbert Bertram Strong 13 February 1880 – 8 October 1944 was an English professional golfer He was an organizer and founding member of the PGA of America and later became a successful golf course architect As a player Strong s best finish in a major championship was ninth place in the 1913 U S Open Strong was born on 13 February 1880 in Ramsgate Kent England to William R Strong 1846–1899 and Charlotte E Strong née Stock 1850–1923 Like many golfers from his era he was first introduced to golf via his participation as a caddie when he toted bags at Royal St George s Golf Club located in Sandwich England in the mid 1890s 1 In 1905 he emigrated to the United States departing Liverpool on 14 June 1905 aboard the RMS Teutonic which arrived in New York on 22 June 1905 with $400 in his pocket a hefty sum at the time 2 Rodman Wanamaker the wealthy proprietor of the Wanamaker department stores now Macy s and a number of golf professionals—including the legendary Walter Hagen and leading amateurs of the era—gathered at Wanamaker s invitation for a luncheon at the Taplow Club in the Martinique Hotel on Broadway and West 32nd Street in New York City on 17 January 1916 Wanamaker believed golf professionals could enhance equipment sales if they formed an association 3 It was during this meeting that Strong James Hepburn Jack Hobens Jack Mackie James Maiden Gilbert Nicholls and Robert White were chosen as the organizing committee of the PGA of America 4 Later in 1916 Strong was appointed as the first Secretary Treasurer 5 The Taplow Club gathering initiated a series of several meetings over the next several months and on 10 April 1916 the PGA of America was officially established with 35 charter members Wanamaker proposed that the newly formed organization hold an annual tournament and offered to donate money for a trophy and prize fund That October the first annual PGA Championship took place at the Siwanoy Country Club in Bronxville New York James M Barnes defeated Jock Hutchison in the championship match taking home the Wanamaker Trophy and $2 580 as his share of the purse 3 Strong competed in the 1899 Open Championship at Royal St George s Golf Club located in Sandwich England He played as an amateur scored 89 and 90 and missed the cut by 8 strokes 6 By 1902 he had become the professional at the Gog Magog Golf Club near Cambridge 7 8 In a friendly match against Tom Vardon at Sandwich on 27 May 1903 Strong made a hole in one likely wind assisted on a par 4 hole 7 He entered the 1903 Open Championship held at Prestwick Golf Club South Ayrshire Scotland but failed to advance past the half way cut In the 1904 Open Championship again held on his home course at Sandwich Strong opened with a first round 93—in windy and cold conditions—but could only improve to 88 in round two when the weather improved He ended up missing the cut by 13 strokes which came at 168 9 In 1905 he emigrated to the United States and became the professional at The Apawamis Club 10 in Rye New York a course featuring pronounced land forms and blind shots When you combine this with his time spent at Royal St George s the course nearest his home where he learned to play golf you start to see a lot of his architectural influence 11 In 1911 he moved to Inwood Country Club and remodeled the course over several years eventually leading to the course hosting the 1921 PGA Championship and the 1923 U S Open On 16 September 1905 Strong partnered with 18 year old Jerome Travers to tie for second place shooting 72 in a four ball tournament—part of the 1905 Metropolitan Open—that was held at Fox Hills Golf Club on Staten Island 12 Source 13 Engineers Country Club 11 was founded in 1917 by a group of engineers from Manhattan The club features a bold course with titanic undulating green complexes and wide hole corridors built on terrain that at times slashes upward or cascades sharply downward to greens protected by dramatic bunkers Within those features are subtle touches that only those familiar with the course recognize the well placed roll in the fairway or the slight green contouring that sends putts in directions that seemingly defy the law of gravity Strong was able to complete construction of the golf course in only 27 months time 16 Devereux Emmet remodeled part of the course in 1921 The course hosted the 1919 PGA Championship and the 1920 U S Amateur A sports writer of the time wrote in August 1920 No young club in the history of golf let it go back 400 years has come in for as much discussion and comment as Engineers The main nerve test will be on the greens You will find strong men weeping as they finish a round 17 Some critics of Strong s design work on Engineers described it as a bag of tricks 18 Strong s architectural work was to be commended as praise worthy for its originality 19 He excelled in making his golf courses stand out with interesting features such as multi tiered greens and deep cavernous bunkers Strong managed to advance his art form to a higher level not always approached by other architects 19 Asked to articulate his philosophy of golf course design Strong said the duty of the golf architect is to build natural beauty into every possible feature of play 20 He believed in the need for good shot making and felt that a player should pay a high price for a poorly executed shot—occasionally with very dire results His greens were what set him apart and often set more of the strategy than the equally daunting bunkers He designed boldly contoured greens that required careful approach from the ideal side of the fairway to avoid running through the green and into trouble beyond Strong is credited with designing the first island green in the United States Strong designed this oft copied challenge—the dreaded 9th hole—in 1928 on the Ocean Course at Ponte Vedra Inn and Club The course was scheduled to host the 1939 Ryder Cup matches if World War II had not intervened The island itself lying 157 yards from the tee is edged by palm trees and peppered with bunkers the hole seldom plays easy due to stiff ocean breezes The Ocean Course was redesigned by Robert Trent Jones Sr in 1947 then again by Bobby Weed in 1998 The 1947 redesign by Jones was an attempt to reduce some of the severity of Strong s design features 21 —Strong on his architectural philosophy At Engineers Country Club Strong s routing approached the hills from every conceivable angle making a full and varied use of the available topography He designed holes that played straight up the hill had holes traversing along the crests with second shots to green sites placed below and even from one hill to the next He brought you in at an angle and off the top of hills and slopes depending on what topography he could take advantage of His course design skills were even more impressive at Fairmont Le Manoir Richelieu 22 where he managed to build a great course on a very severe piece of topography with 400 feet of elevation change The newspaper columnist and Bobby Jones biographer O B Keeler wrote so excellent an authority as Walter Travis the grand old man of American golf was heard to state rather freely that several of the holes at Engineers Country Club were too severe 23 If there is any criticism of Strong s golf course architecture it would likely be due to the severity of his design of greens and their ability to repel poor shots and even good shots if they hit the green at the wrong speed or angle His green designs often incorporated two tiers and sometimes featured a crowned central area in the manner of fellow golf course architect Donald Ross 24 that rewarded only the finest of shots poor shots would drift off the back and to the sides of greens and greens incorporating false fronts would agonize players whose shots were short and not reaching the central plateau of the green Most players of his era—playing with wood shafted clubs—struggled with the boldness originality and aggressiveness of the architectural forms that he used The original Fairmont Le Manoir Richelieu course in Quebec Canada is full of fascinating holes that traverse an extremely hilly and severe property 11 Strong possessed the ability to find good holes on land that seemed far too severe for golf and had the gumption to build very bold and distinctive holes that are open to criticism but clearly are more thought provoking and interesting than most other architect s work The green slopes that he envisioned and built on his courses were the single best defense of a hole 11 The 1913 U S Open was the 19th U S Open held 18–20 September at The Country Club in Brookline Massachusetts a suburb southwest of Boston Amateur Francis Ouimet age 20 won his only U S Open title in an 18 hole playoff five strokes ahead of British stars Harry Vardon and Ted Ray 9 Strong was in contention to win after two rounds of play and was referred to in the Aberdeen Journal as the sometime Sandwich caddie 1 An article in the Indianapolis Star published on 19 September 1913 referred to Strong as a dark horse of the first magnitude 25 after he scored surprisingly well in rounds one and two playing alone and without a partner Due to an uneven number of players in the field Strong ended up playing all four rounds alone with only a scoring official accompanying him on the course 18 Strong s game was enhanced by his masterful ability to hit the short approach shot 26 His weakness at times was erratic putting 27 28 Despite his small physique—he weighed only 120 pounds—he was described as a long hitter of the ball and he insisted that his size was not a handicap 29 The first two rounds were played Thursday and the final two rounds on Friday Strong s fine results in the first two rounds put him on 149 tied for second place with Ray two strokes behind the second round leader Vardon who stood at 147 Strong s play was remarkable for its steadiness rather than any particular brilliancy as he methodically hit fairways and greens and seldom found himself in trouble 25 Strong beat or tied eventual winner Francis Ouimet in rounds 1 2 and 4 30 A disappointing third round 82 however ruined any chance he had to win the tournament and he would eventually finish on 310 +18 to par for a ninth place finish 31

Jordan yielded one son and a daughter Strong died at age 64 of a heart attack in Fort Pierce Florida on 8 October 1944 5 He is best remembered as a prolific golf course architect in the early 20th

the amateur champion golfer of Hawaii Chung relocated to Los Angeles California where he became the first Chinese American professional golfer and pioneer non white member of the Professional Golf Association Chung was a 1995 inductee into the Hawaii Golf Hall of Fame Charles Chung commonly known by the nickname Charlie was born in Honolulu Hawaii in 1902 of ethnic Chinese parents who came from Canton Province China to work as indentured servants on the plantations of Hawaii In his early years Chung s family lived in Nuuanu Valley and his parents had moved from the plantations to work on truck farms Chung supplemented the family income by selling local fruits and vegetables Chung left school after the eighth grade to work and support his family As a teenager he was a clerk for E O Hall and Sons a sporting goods company Chung had an affection for the game of golf at an early age first playing on his own with crude clubs fashioned of guava sticks 1 Chung s love for the game drove him to take a job as a caddie at the Oahu Country Club as a young boy where he gained access to the course and equipment 2 Chung credited his development as a golfer to local player Jimmy Greigh for whom he caddied for a number of years and who provided him in turn with quality instruction 2 Chung quit his caddie s position in 1918 and joined the Honolulu Golf Club as a member himself the following year where he further developed his game 2 As an adult Chung was able to drive the ball up to 250 yards 2 – no mean feat given the primitive equipment of the day Chung regarded his pitching wedge as the best of the eight clubs in his bag however 2 Success came quickly for Chung on the Hawaiian amateur golf circuit including three victories at the Moanalua Championship and two runner up finishes in the Hawaiian Open 2 Chung s second place finish in the 1921 Hawaiian Open helped motivate him to take his game to tournaments in the United States 3 Chung left Hawaii for the United States mainland for the first time the following year where he participated in the U S Open at the Skokie Country Club in Glencoe Illinois in July and the U S Amateur at The Country Club in Brookline Massachusetts in September 3 Chung s participation in the white dominated world of American golf was met with frequent ridicule in sports pages of the country with one 1922 story patronizingly referring to Chung as the only big league oriental golf shark of the links and intimated that he learned of the sport from the strange words used by humorable boss while working as a clerk in a sugar company office 4 One day Charlie learned that this language referred to a game called golf and soon he was forsaking his clerkly duties for the tees the wire story mockingly and falsely alleged 4 Back in Hawaii Chung won the 1924 Manoa Cup an amateur championship tournament played annually at the Honolulu Golf Club today s Oahu Country Club 5 Chung repeated as Hawaii s amateur champion the following year emerging victorious in a revised format under which the final two rounds made use of the match play format 5 Chung became the first non white player to play at the Pebble Beach golf course in 1925 when he was invited to play the California State Amateur tournament Chung did well in the State Amateur He tied George Von Elm who went on to win the tournament for second at the end of the medal qualifying rounds but was eliminated by former champion Max Behr in the first round of match play He then went on to win the defeated sixteen 6 Jack James writer for the San Francisco Examiner headlined Chung as Hero in Defeat Used Savings to come to U S James noted that the real story of the State Amateur was not the winner but the loser Charlie Chung who invaded the rich man s game and proved that a young man of moderate means can keep up with those more freely blessed with worldly goods He admired Chung for taking the loss like a sportsman and a Chinese gentlemen whom there is no finer specimen of the breed in the world 7 1 Bill Wise Los Angeles Times columnist wrote that Chung is going to write history in California golf annals 8 E Z Crane said Chung has done a lot for Hawaii in the way of publicity during his present tour and wondered whether Chung would turn professional 9 Crane later described Chung as the second best amateur golfer on the Pacific Coast second to George Von Elm quoting Willard Crummy professional at the distinguished White Bear Yacht Club course in St Paul Minnesota 10 In December 1925 the most prominent golf publication of its time The American Golfer edited by Grantland Rice featured Chung in a full page article Author Frank P Noon headlined Chung as the Only Champion Chinese Golfer and described his golfing accomplishments his dreams and ambitions and Confucian philosophy toward the game 11 His amateur success gained him notice and employment the following year when the Redlands Country Club of Redlands California hired him

https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Schwab_Challenge,Golf,,,"The Colonial National Invitation titled for sponsorship reasons as the Charles Schwab Challenge since 2019 is a professional golf tournament on the PGA Tour played annually in May in Fort Worth Texas at Colonial Country Club which organizes the event It is one of five invitational tournaments on the PGA Tour the inaugural event was held 75 years ago in 1946 The tournament was founded 75 years ago in 1946 2 and honors the history of golf by using an official Scottish tartan plaid jacket for its champions and top committee chairmen Another tradition feeding Colonial history is the Wall of Champions on the first tee engraved with the name and score of each champion dating back to 1946 plus the 1975 Tournament Players Championship 1941 U S Open and 1991 U S Women s Open The tournament is unofficially associated with Ben Hogan 1912–1997 the long time Fort Worth resident who won the tournament five times 3 the most of any player One of the top players in golf history he won nine major titles six after a near fatal automobile collision in 1949 that kept him hospitalized for two months Hogan s final three major wins were consecutive in 1953 a statue of him at swing completion is near the clubhouse 4 Annika Sörenstam played in the 2003 tournament and became the first woman to play in a PGA Tour event in 58 years since Babe Zaharias made three cuts as an amateur in 1945 5 6 Sörenstam s participation drew high media attention but she shot 71 and 74 and missed the cut by four strokes 7 In 2020 the tournament is scheduled to be played June 11–14 as the first PGA Tour event staged since the interruption of the regular schedule due to the COVID 19 pandemic In the interests of maximum health and safety the tournament will be played with no spectators attending a PGA Tour first The Charles Schwab Corporation became the title sponsor of the event for a four year deal starting in 2019 8 Previous sponsors were Dean Deluca 2016–2017 Crowne Plaza 2007–2015 Bank of America 2003–2006 MasterCard 1996–2002 and Southwestern Bell 1989–1994 There was no title sponsor in 1995 or 2018 9 The event name had Colonial in its title through 2015 when the Crowne Plaza Invitational at Colonial was renamed the Dean DeLuca Invitational Even the unsponsored 2018 event used the name Fort Worth Invitational as opposed to Colonial National Invitation which was used the last time the event was without a sponsor back in 1995 The 2018 tournament renamed the Fort Worth Invitational was held through the support of four local corporate supporters that had stepped in to provide financial support after Dean DeLuca suddenly pulled out of a six year sponsorship agreement American Airlines AT T XTO Energy Inc and Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway agreed to help fund the 2018 tournament to allow time for the PGA TOUR and Colonial Country Club to find a new sponsor The Charles Schwab Challenge is one of only five tournaments given invitational status by the PGA Tour and consequently it has a reduced field of approximately 120 players as opposed to most full field open tournaments with a field of 144 or 156 players The other four tournaments with invitational status are the Genesis Open Arnold Palmer Invitational the RBC Heritage and the Memorial Tournament However the 2020 event was staged with 144 players to help make up for the loss of several tournaments canceled earlier in the year Invitational tournaments have smaller fields between 120 and 132 players and have more freedom than full field open tournaments in determining which players are eligible to participate in their event as invitational tournaments have slightly different criteria for player eligibility in the PGA Tour Priority Ranking System Furthermore unlike full field open tournaments invitational tournaments do not offer open qualifying aka Monday qualifying The field consists of at least 120 players invited using the following criteria 10 11 Colonial winners prior to 2000 that are not otherwise eligible are in addition to a field of 120 Colonial has a unique PGA Tour tradition known as the Champion s Choice invitation Each year former Colonial champions select two deserving young players who otherwise would be ineligible to compete in the tournament Pros who made their first appearance at Colonial as a Champion s Choice include Al Geiberger Tom Weiskopf Craig Stadler Curtis Strange Mark O Meara Paul Azinger Davis Love III and Jordan Spieth Five Champion s Choices have eventually won the Colonial

confirmed Tackett s ruling as correct DeChambeau went on to shoot a quintuple bogey 10 on the hole and missed the cut 35 36 Just two weeks later at the WGC FedEx St Jude Invitational DeChambeau s tee shot at the 7th stopped on top of some small sticks near the base of a tree He attempted to argue that there were red ants in the immediate area of the ball and asked for a free drop under the rule that allows a drop when a dangerous animal such as poisonous snakes stinging bees alligators a single hornet fire ants or bears near a ball could cause serious physical injury to the player He spent nearly three minutes attempting to convince the official by coincidence Tackett again but ultimately had to play the ball as it lay He finished the hole with a double bogey 6 36 Brooks Koepka later poked fun at DeChambeau faking as though he was summoning a rules official in response to an ant infestation 37 All of DeChambeau s irons and wedges are cut to exactly the same length 37 5 inches 95 3 cm 38 Their lie and bounce angles are also the same only the lofts are different In addition to the single length concept his clubs are unusual for their extremely upright lie angle 39 He also uses custom made carbon graphite shafts on all of his clubs including his putter He is a first to do so among PGA Tour players 40 DeChambeau keeps the club on the same plane throughout his swing and does not turn his wrists during his swing 41 In 2011 at the suggestion of his instructor Mike Schy DeChambeau switched to JumboMax Grips the largest grips commercially available which allow him to hold the club in his palms rather than his fingers 42 Source 43 PGA Tour playoff record 1–0 Web com Tour playoff record 1–0 Results not in chronological order in 2020 LA = Low amateur CUT = missed the half way

three years Under the tutelage of Rhodes Elder was able to polish his game and he began playing in tournaments In 1959 Elder was drafted into the Army and was sent to Fort Lewis Washington While at Fort Lewis Elder had the good fortune to be under the command of Colonel John Gleaster who was an avid golfer Gleaster put Elder in a special services unit which allowed him the opportunity to play

Florida the same tournament at which he claimed his first PGA Tour victory six years later to qualify for the Masters Elder and other black players on tour were forced to change their clothes in the parking lot because members of the club would not allow African Americans in their clubhouse While playing in a tournament in Memphis Tennessee a spectator picked up Elder s ball on a hole and threw it in a hedge The incident was witnessed by another pro golfer and Elder was given a free drop Elder tried to stay focused on the game but unlike the majority of players on tour he was constantly

https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_B._Macdonald,Golf,,,Charles Blair Macdonald November 14 1855 – April 21 1939 was a major figure in early American golf He built the first 18 hole course in the United States was a driving force in the founding of the United States Golf Association won the first U S Amateur championship and later built some of the most influential golf courses in the United States to the extent that he is considered the father of American golf course architecture He is a member of the World Golf Hall of Fame Macdonald was born in Niagara Falls Ontario to naturalized American parents — a Scottish father and Canadian part Mohawk mother — and grew up in Chicago In 1872 at age 16 he was sent to St Andrews University 1 and while there he took up playing golf with a vengeance Tutored by Old Tom Morris Macdonald soon became proficient enough that he played matches on the Old Course at St Andrews against several of the leading golfers of the day including Young Tom Morris 2 Macdonald returned to Chicago in 1874 and became a successful stockbroker but rarely played golf for the next 17 years a period he termed the Dark Ages 3 In 1894 the Newport Country Club and Saint Andrew s Golf Club both held national championship tournaments Macdonald finished second in both and on both occasions he angrily denounced the manner in which each competition was held with the result that both tournaments were declared unofficial 2 That fall delegates from the Chicago Golf Club including Macdonald Saint Andrew s The Country Club Newport Country Club and Shinnecock Hills Golf Club met in New York City to resolve the problem The result was the formation of the United States Golf Association USGA which would administer the official championship Macdonald was named Vice President of the organization The first U S Amateur was held in 1895 at the Newport Country Club and this time Macdonald won beating Charles Sands 12 11 in the final which is still the record winning margin By the late 1880s a group of Scottish immigrants had brought the game to the New York City area playing at the Saint Andrew s Golf Club In 1892 Macdonald convinced several associates to begin playing Shortly thereafter he founded the Chicago Golf Club At first Macdonald built nine rudimentary holes in Downers Grove Illinois these nine holes comprised the first golf course west of the Allegheny Mountains In 1893 he expanded the course to 18 holes creating the first full length course in the United States Shortly thereafter in 1894 the Chicago Golf Club decided to move to a permanent home in nearby Wheaton Illinois Macdonald built a new 18 hole course there a layout which is still the club s home today and has hosted multiple U S Opens routinely continuing to rank as one of the top 50 golf courses in the world the original 1892 site is now the Downers Grove Golf Course 4 In 1895 he designed the first nine holes at Onwentsia Club of Lake Forest Illinois In 1900 Macdonald left Chicago to live in New York becoming a partner in the Wall Street brokerage firm of C D Barney through mergers now Morgan Stanley Wealth Management 4 With only a couple of exceptions most golf courses in the U S at that time were laid out in rudimentary fashion with little strategy required of the golfer Macdonald by virtue of his experiences at St Andrews and later trips to Great Britain was determined not immodestly to build the most noteworthy course outside the British Isles He searched Long Island for a suitable site to emulate the classic seaside links of Scotland and eventually settled on a site in Southampton New York near Shinnecock Hills Golf Club in 1906 5 He dubbed the Southampton home at 119 Whites Lane Ballyshear and the house was designed by F Burrall Hoffman The home was purchased by Michael Bloomberg in 2011 6 In 1908 he organized a group of 70 founders to contribute $1 000 each and the National Golf Links of America opened for play in 1909 7 Many of the holes were his versions of famous holes from British courses a pattern he would repeat on later courses Macdonald would tweak the course for the rest of his life altering every hole somewhat over the next 30 years The course hosted the inaugural Walker Cup in 1922 and is considered a landmark of golf architecture even today In 2005 Golf Digest ranked it the #9 course in the United States With the National Golf Links course Macdonald began collaborating with Seth Raynor who would later become a famous golf architect a term coined by Macdonald in about 1910 8 in his own right The pair would collaborate on a number of courses over the years These included the Old White Course at The Greenbrier 1914 St Louis Country Club 1914 the Shinnecock Hills Golf Course 1916 the Yale University golf course 1926 and the Mid Ocean Club in Bermuda a course conceived to escape the reach of Prohibition 9 1921 One of the most famous was the Lido Golf Club 1914 a course which took an enormous amount of effort to construct and had several unique holes and was considered at least on par with the National Golf Links while it existed a course by the same name exists near its location today but it was built by Robert Trent Jones in 1947 2 10 11 In 1928 Macdonald published his book Scotland s Gift Golf which covers the spread of golf prominently featuring himself in the United States from its beginnings in the early 1890s to 1927 when there were some 4 000 courses in the country It devotes several chapters to four of his courses and gives his design philosophy He is often called the Father of American Golf Architecture 12 MacDonald identified 21 different hole designs or templates from the greatest holes in the British Isles that would test a great player s game while allowing mediocre and poor players angles and options to score well These template holes are typically pretty easy to identify after a little schooling While these holes are similar from course to course they are not duplicates Each hole was designed specifically for the site to create a unique twist for players Several of MacDonald s classic templates are The list of courses that Macdonald either designed alone or co designed are listed below Some courses are defunct Lido Golf Club some have been substantially redesigned Shinnecock Hills Golf Club and others have not been substantially altered St Louis Country Club Bermuda Connecticut Florida Illinois Maryland Missouri New York West Virginia In 2007 Macdonald was elected as a member of the World Golf Hall of Fame in the Lifetime

although he was a runner up in the 1955 Coombe Hill Assistants Tournament behind Peter Mills 5 In 1958 Butler became joint professional with Button at Harborne and played more regularly on the British circuit He had achieved little success when in May 1959 he was the surprise winner of the Swallow Penfold Tournament Rounds of 75 72 67 66 gave him a one stroke win ahead of Harry Weetman and the £1 000 first prize Butler had trailed Weetman by eight strokes after the first two rounds 6 7 Butler had his second important success in 1962 winning the Yorkshire Evening News Tournament four ahead of Ken Bousfield and taking another £1 000 prize Like his 1959 win this was also something of a surprise since he had achieved relatively little in the interim period 8 1963 started with his third £1 000 win the Schweppes PGA Close Championship where he finished two strokes ahead of Bobby Walker The event was played at Royal Birkdale in a strong wind with bare greens His winning score of 306 was the

had another good season in 1965 He continued his good run in the Schweppes PGA Close Championship losing in a sudden death playoff to Peter Alliss and in May he won the Martini International 18

Tournament and the French Open 22 He also won the Bowmaker Tournament for the second time with a final round of 61 23 Butler s poor 1966 season meant he was outside the top 10 in the Ryder Cup points list and he missed out on a place in the 1967 Ryder Cup 24 The year finished on a successful note with a win in the Piccadilly Medal 25 Butler had one of his best seasons in 1968 winning the Penfold

second shots Donald played a pitch for his third shot to leave himself a putt of no more than six feet for birdie Westwood s approach shot to the green spun back into the water hazard Westwood chipped

Championship Donald in defence of his title he won in 2011 was eliminated in the opening round by South African Ernie Els who beat him 5 4 He was in danger of being knocked off the top of the world rankings as both Rory McIlroy and Lee Westwood progressed to the semi finals either would have taken over the top spot by winning the tournament However neither could win the title and Donald kept his number one status However he did lose his status the following week after electing not to play at The Honda Classic McIlroy won the tournament and took over as world number one Two weeks later Donald

player to do so until 2003 5 Daly s last PGA Tour victory came in San Diego in 2004 earning him a two year playing exemption After 2006 Daly s career began to falter and he had trouble making cuts and staying on the tour He was primarily earning PGA Tour event entries through past champion status and numerous sponsor invitations Daly is the only man from either Europe or the United States to win two major golf championships but not be selected for the Ryder Cup since that event began in 1927 Daly has been successful in multiple businesses He is endorsed by LoudMouth Golf Apparel and owns a golf course design company In addition Daly has written and recorded music and has released two music albums Daly was born in Carmichael California His father is Jim Daly a construction worker for industrial plants his mother is Lou Daly homemaker The Daly family solidly middle class moved very frequently during Daly s formative years living in small towns across the southern states His father frequently worked night shifts and often had to commute significant distances between work and home 6 With his father mother older sister and older brother Jamie John moved from California to Dardanelle Arkansas when he was four years old John began playing golf the following year at the Bay Ridge Boat and Golf Club there From his start in golf Daly admired Jack Nicklaus the dominant professional player of the time 7 When John was ten his family moved to Locust Grove Orange County Virginia John played golf there at the Lake of the Woods Golf Course in Locust Grove where he won the spring club championship at age 13 defeating all the male members the club promptly changed its rules barring juniors from future open club competition 8 The Dalys next moved to Zachary Louisiana where John completed ninth grade and half of tenth grade 9 John then attended Helias High School in Jefferson City Missouri the state capital from the middle of his grade ten year and was a junior golf member at the Jefferson City Country Club He was a letterman there in football and golf With John handling both punting and place kicking duties Helias football compiled a 10–0 record in 1983 In golf John was a 1983 Missouri state team HS champion with Helias he also holds several Helias school kicking records in football For his first significant golf success Daly won the 1983 Missouri State Amateur Championship and then followed up by winning the 1984 Arkansas State Amateur Championship 2 Daly completed his final three months of high school at Dardanelle High School in spring 1984 Back at the Bay Ridge club that summer Daly became friends with Rick Ross who was a golf teaching professional there and Ross assisted him with his golf game for the next several years 10 Daly attended the University of Arkansas from 1984 to 1987 on a golf scholarship and was a member of the golf team His golf team coaches were Steve Loy and Bill Woodley and Daly had tempestuous relationships with both due to his drinking problems and infrequent class attendance Daly qualified for the 1986 U S Open one of the four majors of male professional golf as an amateur and missed the 36 hole cut with scores of 88 and 76 6 11 12 Daly left college without completing his degree and turned professional in summer 1987 His first pro victory came shortly afterwards in the 1987 Missouri Open 6 From 1987 to 1989 Daly played mainly in minor events around the U S and had some encouraging success in South Africa in early 1989 where he challenged in several Sunshine Tour events He also played in several PGA Tour events with some success including finishing T 14 at the 1989 Chattanooga Classic and making his first cut in a major finishing T 69 at the 1989 U S Open He earned full playing privileges on the Ben Hogan Tour now the Korn Ferry Tour for 1990 winning the qualifying tournament for the new circuit early that year 6 He then won two Sunshine Tour events early in 1990 one in South Africa where he edged David Feherty and one in Swaziland where established veteran champion John Bland placed second 2 This was encouraging for Daly to win good caliber events defeat more experienced and well established international professionals and play before good sized galleries which appreciated his performances He then won the 1990 Ben Hogan Utah Classic and completed a fine year by finishing T 12 at the 1990 PGA Tour Qualifying Tournament earning 1991 PGA Tour privileges on his fourth attempt 13 He joined the PGA Tour in 1991 showed increasingly strong play throughout the year and then won the PGA Championship that August This victory gained Daly a significant amount of media attention due to the fact that Daly was the ninth and final alternate for the Championship Just days before the tournament Nick Price dropped out since his wife Sue was about to give birth Daly playing just his third major was able to have Price s caddie Jeff Squeaky Medlin caddy for him Daly had to drive through the night to arrive in time to claim his spot A virtual unknown at the time he achieved a first round score of 69 even though he had not had time to play a practice round at the exceptionally difficult Crooked Stick Golf Club course near Indianapolis He finished the tournament with scores of 69 67 69 71 giving him a three stroke victory over veteran Bruce Lietzke who was 15 years older His feat generated enormous media coverage propelling the hitherto virtually unknown Tour rookie to international fame 6 Late in the season Daly became the first PGA Tour rookie to be invited to compete in the Skins Game a made for television event featuring four top players and he performed well there 6 Daly was subsequently named PGA Tour Rookie of the Year for 1991 He was also the first rookie to win a major title since Jerry Pate won the U S Open in 1976 14 15 His surprise victory and powerful swing provided the impetus for a cult like fan base composed of many people who had not been previously attracted to golf and from that point onwards Daly became one of the most popular players on Tour 16 He added to his reputation as a power hitter in 1993 by becoming apparently the first and still the only player to reach the green of the famous 630 yard hole 17 at Baltusrol Golf Club s Lower Course in two strokes 17 Daly had a good season in 1992 with several top 10 finishes including finishing 5th place at The International T 2 at the Kemper Open and T 8 at the Buick Southern Open and the Nissan Los Angeles Open At the 1992 PGA Championship Daly struggled as the defending champion He finished the tournament with rounds of 76 72 79 77 and ended up finishing in 82nd place However he recovered to win the B C Open by six strokes late in the season for his second PGA Tour title 6 Daly did not have a great season in 1993 He did however finish T 3 at the Masters Tournament and it became his only top 10 finish in a major championship outside his two wins With no PGA Tour wins in 1993 Daly did manage to win the Alfred Dunhill Cup with Fred Couples and Payne Stewart He had five top 25 finishes and one top 10 finish out of 15 cuts In 1994 Daly experienced one of his most turbulent years He was suspended by the PGA Tour due to behavior which included walking off the course mid round during the 1993 late season Kapalua International The suspension also covered a mid 1993 incident at the Kemper Open when he was upset after scoring a 77 threw his scorecard at the scoring tent and was disqualified He entered alcohol rehab for three weeks in late 1993 6 and then returned to the Tour and won the 1994 BellSouth Classic claiming it was his first win sober This was his third PGA Tour title In 1995 in the midst of a middling season Daly unexpectedly won The Open Championship in a playoff with Italy s Costantino Rocca at the Old Course St Andrews Daly had had prior excellent results on this course at the Dunhill Cup and although he was listed at very long odds by bookies some perceptive golf watchers including David Feherty believed before the event that the Old Course in fact suited Daly s game very well Daly was in contention from the start of the event but trailed New Zealand s Michael Campbell heading into a very windy final round Campbell fell back in the difficult conditions and Daly played a superb final round As Rocca in the last group approached the final hole he was one shot behind Daly who had already finished his round Rocca s long drive was only yards from the green but his second shot resulted in a fluffed chip where he did not follow through Rocca then sank a 60 foot 18 metre putt to make the birdie he needed to force a playoff with Daly Daly easily defeated Rocca in the playoff finishing the four holes of the playoff at one under par while Rocca finished three over par after hitting into the Road Hole Bunker on the 17th hole and taking three shots to get out 6 Daly is the only eligible two time major winner never selected to play in the Ryder Cup After winning the 1995 Open Championship Daly struggled with his golf game and drinking habits for the next nine years In 1996 Daly finished T 19 at The Players Championship and had a top 10 finish at the Kemper Open At the 1996 U S Open Daly finished T 27 with a second round 69 which was his best finish in the tournament In 1997 Daly withdrew from the U S

1998 season with two top 10 finishes He also withdrew from the Sprint International and the Disney Classic and was disqualified from the FedEx St Jude Classic In 1999 Daly won the JCPenney Classic which was neither a PGA or European Tour event Despite this Daly did not have a good season in 1999 where he withdrew from several tournaments and scored a high round of 82 at the Memorial Tournament At the 1999 U S Open Daly finished 68th place after leading the tournament in the first round After some struggles during the tournament Daly said he would never play in the U S Open again he later apologized for this In 2000 Daly had a bad season withdrawing from the U S Open with 12 over par In 2001 Daly won the BMW International Open with a one stroke lead over Pádraig Harrington with a personal best score of 27 under par for four rounds This was the first time Daly had won a European Tour event in six years After Daly had a comeback to the European Tour he also had his best PGA Tour season since 1995 His best result was finishing 4th place at the Bell Canadian Open In 2002 Daly was inducted into the Arkansas Golf Hall of Fame and had two top 10 finishes on the PGA Tour He made the cut at the 2002 Masters finishing T 32 the last time he would make the cut at the Masters He also won the Champions Challenge that year which was neither a PGA or European Tour event In 2003 Daly

was defeated by Vijay Singh s par on the first extra hole at the Houston Open Then he missed a two foot putt on the second extra hole to lose to Tiger Woods at the WGC American Express Championship in San Francisco Daly did not win another professional tournament until December 2014 when he won the Beko Classic The tournament played at Gloria Golf Club in Belek Antalya Turkey is sanctioned by the PGA of Europe 19 Daly s last top finish on an elite tour came at the 2009 Italian Open There he finished in a distant tie for second to Daniel Vancsik of Argentina It punctuated how unusual Daly s history of results had been He recorded almost as many top finishes internationally as he did at PGA Tour events in the United States He won two events on the South African Tour early in his career the AECI Charity Classic and the Hollard Royal Swazi Sun Classic in 1990 an event where he had finished runner up in 1989 20 Later in his career in addition to famously winning the 1995 Open

2003 Korea Open the most prestigious event on the Korean Tour Daly entered the 2007 PGA Tour season without full exempt status for the first time since his 1991 PGA Championship victory which carried a 10 year PGA Tour exemption Another such exemption was earned with his 1995 Open Championship win When Daly won the 2004 Buick Invitational he earned a two year exemption which expired at the end of 2006 Daly finished 193rd on the 2006 PGA Tour Official Money List 22 thereby losing his full exempt status for 2007 Although Daly had $10 116 306 in career earnings as of June 2 2014 he is not among the top 50 on the PGA Tour s All Time Career Money List 23 and so he must now depend heavily on sponsor invitations PGA Tour Exemption Category 11 24 Some 2007 PGA Tour events extended such invitations Outside of sponsor invitations Daly can also play in many 2007 regular events via Exemption Category 32 24 Past Champions Team Tournament Winners and Veteran Members Beyond 150 on Money List As far as individual tournaments are concerned Daly is exempt for life in the PGA Championship and AT T Pebble Beach National Pro Am and up to age 60 in the Open Championship In order to play in the Masters U S Open a World Golf Championship or a FedEx Cup Playoff Event Daly would have to satisfy the particular invitational requirements of such events Daly has not played at the Masters since 2006 and he has not made the cut there since 2002 25 To upgrade his non exempt status Daly could have re entered the PGA Tour qualifying process but chose not to do this relying upon sponsor exemptions to gain entry to PGA Tour events Fans and golf columnists point to the 2005 WGC American Express Championship as the event where John Daly s post 2006 exempt status would be determined Tied with Tiger Woods at the end of regulation play Daly missed a short par putt on the 2nd extra playoff hole giving Woods the victory Had Daly instead made the par and then had gone on to win he would have earned a three year PGA Tour exemption through 2008 26 Daly also made it to another playoff in the 2005 Shell Houston Open but lost on the first extra hole to Vijay Singh 19 Daly was invited to play in the Honda Classic on March 1 2007 on a sponsor s exemption but had to withdraw after two holes He pulled a muscle near his shoulder blade when he tried to stop his backswing after a fan snapped a picture 27 In December 2008 he was suspended for six months by the PGA Tour 28 After his 2008 suspension Daly was forced to compete on the European Tour After undergoing lap band surgery to lose 40 pounds 29 he began playing much better golf even managing to finish 2nd 30 at the Italian Open On May 26 2009 Daly announced that he would return to the PGA Tour 31 via sponsor s exemption for the St Jude Classic On July 17 Daly told The Dan Patrick Show that he had lost 80 pounds thanks to the surgery dropping him to 205 lbs However after shooting a then personal high 88 at the Buick Open in late July 2009 he claimed to be losing confidence in his game and his swing coach blamed the surgery for making him lose muscle along with weight taking power away from his swing However Daly blamed the effects of his poor eyesight on his putting for his high golf score 32 On March 14 2014 during the second round of the Valspar Championship Daly shot a career worst 90 which included an 8 over par 12 on the 16th hole 33 His frequent failure to make cuts and high rounds have revived debates on players who frequently receive sponsor exemptions 34 Daly shot a score of 68 for the first round of the 2012 PGA Championship which was played at Kiawah Island South Carolina 35 Daly finished 18th place in that tournament which was the first time Daly had finished in the top 20 in a major championship since the Open in 2005 Daly continues to play more abroad vs United States due to his limited status on the PGA Tour In the late fall of 2014 Daly started to show some promise finishing T 29 at the Sanderson Farms Championship and then quietly finishing T 10 at the Puerto Rico Open his first top 10 finish in three years Soon after Daly finished T 25 at the Turkish Airlines Open a European Tour event with a strong field Daly won the Beko Classic on December 6 2014 an event sanctioned by the PGAs of Europe finishing at −15 It was Daly s first win in over 10 years 25 At the end

play on the PGA Tour Champions His debut was at the Insperity Invitational in May where he finished tied for 17th 36 On May 7 2017 Daly won the Insperity Invitational on the PGA Tour Champions after shooting a 14 under par for the tournament It was his first win of a PGA Tour affiliated event since 2004 and it happened exactly one year after he made his PGA Tour Champions debut 37 Daly continues to compete semi regularly on the Champions Tour Daly has a flowing self taught golf swing which was built for raw power and distance Daly takes his golf club back much farther past parallel on his back swing by extreme coiling of his arms and shoulders which creates very fast club head speed on his down swing However Daly s golf swing has contributed to his inconsistent performance during golf tournaments since almost perfect timing is required for proper execution of such a powerful golf swing 38 Daly has had several incidents during golf tournaments which have contributed to his Wild Thing image including the following 39 After winning the PGA Championship at Crooked Stick Golf Club in 1991 Daly gave $30 000 to the family of a man who died during the tournament due to lightning strike The money was used by the family to pay college expenses for the man s two daughters Daly was just starting his golf career and was not wealthy at the time 47 Daly is known for his involvement

his game and a positive change in his personal life this was confirmed by Daly himself at the Open on July 15 2010 67 In an interview on the Dan Patrick Show on August 6 2014 Daly said that much of his past struggle with alcohol was due to growing up with an alcoholic and abusive father 68 In July 1994 Daly claimed that many PGA golfers were cocaine users and said that if drug testing was done

https://wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Open_(golf),Golf,,,The United States Open Championship commonly known as the U S Open is the annual open national championship of golf in the United States It is the third of the four major championships in golf and is on the official schedule of both the PGA Tour and the European Tour Since 1898 the competition has been 72 holes of stroke play 4 rounds on an 18 hole course with the winner being the player with the lowest total number of strokes It is staged by the United States Golf Association USGA in mid June scheduled so that if there are no weather delays the final round is played on the third Sunday The U S Open is staged at a variety of courses set up in such a way that scoring is very difficult with a premium placed on accurate driving As of 2019 the U S Open awards a $12 5 million purse the largest of all four major championships and tied for largest of all PGA Tour events The Players Championship also with $12 5 million 1 The first U S Open was played on October 4 1895 on a nine hole course at the Newport Country Club in Newport Rhode Island It was a 36 hole competition and was played in a single day Ten professionals and one amateur entered The winner was Horace Rawlins a 21 year old Englishman who had arrived in the U S earlier that year to take up a position at the host club He received $150 cash out of a prize fund of $335 plus a $50 gold medal his club received the Open Championship Cup trophy which was presented by the USGA 2 3 In the beginning the tournament was dominated by experienced British players until 1911 when John J McDermott became the first native born American winner American golfers soon began to win regularly and the tournament evolved to become one of the four majors Since 1911 the title has been won mostly by players from the United States Since 1950 players from only six countries other than the United States have won the championship most notably South Africa which has won five times since 1965 A streak of four consecutive non American winners occurred from 2004 to 2007 for the first time since 1910 These four players South African Retief Goosen 2004 New Zealander Michael Campbell 2005 Australian Geoff Ogilvy 2006 and Argentine Ángel Cabrera 2007 are all from countries in the Southern Hemisphere Northern Ireland s Graeme McDowell 2010 became the first European player to win the event since Tony Jacklin of England in 1970 three more Europeans won in the next four editions making it only three American wins in the 11 tournaments from 2004 to 2014 U S Open play is characterized by tight scoring at or around par by the leaders with the winner usually emerging at around even par A U S Open course is seldom beaten severely and there have been many over par wins in part because par is usually set at 70 except for the very longest courses Normally an Open course is quite long and will have a high cut of primary rough termed Open rough by the American press and fans undulating greens such as at Pinehurst No 2 in 2005 which was described by Johnny Miller of NBC as like trying to hit a ball on top of a VW Beetle pinched fairways especially on what are expected to be less difficult holes and two or three holes that are short par fives under regular play would be used as long par fours during the tournament often to meet that frequently used par of 70 forcing players to have accurate long drives Some courses that are attempting to get into the rotation for the U S Open will undergo renovations to develop these features Rees Jones is the most notable of the Open Doctors who take on these projects his father Robert Trent Jones had filled that role earlier As with any professional golf tournament the available space surrounding the course for spectators among other considerations and local infrastructure also factor into deciding which courses will host the event The U S Open is open to any professional or to any amateur with a USGA Handicap Index not exceeding 1 4 4 Players male or female 4 may obtain a place by being fully exempt or by competing successfully in qualifying The field is 156 players About half of the field is made up of players who are fully exempt from qualifying The current exemption categories are 5 6 The exemptions for amateurs apply only if the players remain amateurs as of the tournament date except for the U S Amateur On August 5 2019 the USGA announced a rule change stating a player may turn professional and still retain his U S Open exemption Note that this tournament typically takes place after the collegiate season has ended so players may turn professional immediately after their last collegiate event typically the end of the NCAA final of their senior year in order to maximize the number of FedEx Cup points they may score before the August cutoff 8 Before 2011 the sole OWGR cutoff for entry was the top 50 as of two weeks before the tournament An exemption category for the top 50 as of the tournament date was added for 2011 apparently in response to the phenomenon of golfers entering the top 50 between the original cutoff date and the tournament such as Justin Rose and Rickie Fowler in 2010 9 Through 2011 exemptions existed for leading money winners on the PGA European Japanese and Australasian tours as well as winners of multiple PGA Tour events in the year before the U S Open These categories were eliminated in favor of inviting the top 60 on the OWGR at both relevant dates 9 Starting with the 2012 championship an exemption was added for the winner of the current year s BMW PGA Championship the European Tour s equivalent of The Players Championship 10 Potential competitors who are not fully exempt must enter the Qualifying process which has two stages Firstly there is Local Qualifying which is played over 18 holes at more than 100 courses around the United States Many leading players are exempt from this first stage and they join the successful local qualifiers at the Sectional Qualifying stage which is played over 36 holes in one day at several sites in the U S as well as one each in Europe and Japan There is no lower age limit and the youngest ever qualifier was 14 year old Andy Zhang of China who qualified in 2012 after Paul Casey withdrew days before the tournament The USGA has granted a special exemption to 34 players 52 times since 1966 11 Players with multiple special exemptions include Arnold Palmer 1978 1980 1981 1983 1994 Seve Ballesteros 1978 1994 Gary Player 1981 1983 Lee Trevino 1983 1984 Hale Irwin 1990 2002 2003 Jack Nicklaus 1991 1993 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 Tom Watson 1993 1996 2000 2003 2010 12 Irwin won the 1990 U S Open after accepting a special exemption In the 2016 a special exemption was extended to former champion Retief Goosen 2001 2004 13 In 2018 a special exemption was extended to former U S Open champions Jim Furyk 2003 and Ernie Els 1994 1997 14 The purse at the 2017 U S Open was $12 million and the winner s share was $2 16 million The European Tour uses conversion rates at the time of the tournament to calculate the official prize money used in their Race to Dubai €10 745 927 in 2017 In line with the other majors winning the U S Open gives a golfer several privileges that make his career much more secure if he is not already one of the elite players of the sport U S Open champions are automatically invited to play in the other three majors the Masters The Open Championship British Open and the PGA Championship for the next five years They are also automatically invited to play in The Players Championship for the next five years and they are exempt from qualifying for the U S Open itself for 10 years Winners may also receive a five year exemption on the PGA Tour which is automatic for regular members Non PGA Tour members who win the U S Open have the choice of joining the PGA Tour either within 60 days of winning or prior to the beginning of any one of the next five tour seasons Finally U S Open winners receive automatic invitations to three of the five senior majors once they turn 50 they receive a five year invitation to the U S Senior Open and a lifetime invitation to the Senior PGA Championship and Senior British Open The top 10 finishers at the U S Open are fully exempt from qualifying for the following year s Open and the top four are automatically invited to the following season s Masters Up to 2017 the U S Open retained a full 18 hole playoff the following day Monday If a tie existed after that fifth round then the playoff continued as sudden death on the 91st hole The U S Open advanced to sudden death three times 1990 1994 2008 most recently when Tiger Woods defeated Rocco Mediate on the first additional playoff hole in 2008 Before sudden death was introduced in the 1950s additional 18 hole rounds were played 1925 1939 and 1946 to break the tie When the playoff was scheduled for 36 holes and ended in a tie as in 1931 a second 36 hole playoff was required Since 2018 the USGA adopted a two hole aggregate playoff format after consulting fans players and media partners Sudden death will still be played if the playoff ends tied 15 Willie Anderson Bobby Jones Ben Hogan and Jack Nicklaus hold the record for the most U S Open victories with four victories each 16 Hale Irwin is the oldest winner of the U S Open at 45 years and 15 days in 1990 17 The youngest winner of the U S Open is John McDermott at 19 years 10 months 14 days in 1911 17 a denotes amateur The eighteenth state to host the tournament was Washington in 2015 followed by Wisconsin in 2017 There is an extensive records section on the official U S Open website 20 Beginning with the 2020 tournament NBCUniversal holds domestic television rights with coverage on NBC and Golf Channel having taken over the remainder of the 12 year deal with the USGA signed by Fox Sports in 2013 that gave it exclusive rights to USGA championships from 2015 through 2026 With the postponed 2020 U S Open Championship presenting a significant scheduling challenge due to its other fall sports commitments Fox had held discussions with the USGA over broadcasting the tournament on their cable network FS1 or partnering with NBC Ultimately the issues led the network to transfer the final seven years of its contract entirely 21 22 23 Coverage was previously televised by NBC and

second round to lead Scott by one stroke going into the weekend after Scott had recorded a round of 67 In the third round Scott shot a 68 to take a four stroke lead into the final round ahead of Brandt Snedeker and Graeme McDowell In the final round Scott s birdie on the 14th gave him a cushion of four shots with four holes to play On the 15th Scott made bogey after he pulled his approach shot into a greenside bunker At the 16th he overhit his approach shot onto the back of the green to leave a lengthy putt for birdie He missed the putt by about five feet and could not convert the par putt As Scott was playing the 17th Ernie Els had birdied the final hole to become the leader in the clubhouse at seven under one shot behind Scott On the 17th from the middle of the fairway Scott overhit his approach shot and landed in some thick rough at the back of the green He could only pitch out to 20 feet away and missed the resulting putt to record his third bogey and drop into a tie

of the hole resulting in another bogey to finish the round Scott shot a final round of 75 to finish at six under one stroke behind the champion Ernie Els 33 Scott s collapse down the home stretch was compared to many other famous golfing collapses down the years including fellow countryman Greg Norman at the 1996 Masters 34 After the round Scott said that his finish was down to finding some bad positions on the course rather than nerves He also said I m very disappointed but I played so beautifully for most of the week I really shouldn t let this bring me down I know I ve let a really great chance slip through my fingers today but somehow I ll look back and take the positives from it 33 With his second place finish Scott equalled his best ever performance at a major championship alongside his tied second at the 2011 Masters and he returned to the world s top 10 at number six Scott s first appearance after The Open Championship was at the WGC Bridgestone Invitational where he attempted to defend his title from the previous year He ended the week in a tie for 45th place The following week Scott was again in the mix at the PGA Championship entering the final round in the penultimate grouping four shots behind the leader Rory McIlroy In good conditions though Scott shot an over par 73 to drop back into a final position of T11th On 18 November Scott fired a bogey free final round at Kingston Heath in the Melbourne Sandbelt to win the Australian Masters for the first time He trailed defending champion Ian Poulter by one going into the final round but shot a 67

year He finished the event T10th with three rounds under par He then played the two World Golf Championships consecutively losing at the WGC Accenture Match Play Championship in the opening round 2 1 to Tim Clark In the following WGC Cadillac Championship Scott fired the low round of the week on the final day to jump from T19 to T3 behind Tiger Woods and Steve Stricker His last event before the Masters was at the Tampa Bay Championship where he finished T30 36 At the 2013 Masters Tournament Scott emerged from the chasing pack on the final day to enter into a tie for the lead heading into the 72nd hole Scott proceeded to birdie the 18th from a considerable distance prompting wild celebrations as he looked to have won the title However former champion Ángel Cabrera produced an excellent approach and subsequently also birdied the 72nd hole to tie Scott for the lead at −9 leading to a sudden death playoff Both players parred the first hole 18 with Cabrera inches away from birdie On the second hole 10 Cabrera once again missed his birdie putt by inches leaving Scott a 12 foot birdie putt for the championship which Scott holed 37 It was Scott s first major championship and marked the first time an Australian has won the Masters 38 It was also seen by many as redemption for his failure to win the previous year s Open Championship 39 Scott s victory at the Masters moved him to No 3 in the Official World Golf Ranking equalling his career high ranking Scott s win received some controversy as he won using a long putter being the first winner of the Masters to do so On 29 November 2012 it was announced by the USGA and R A golf s two governing bodies that belly and long putters would be banned from competition effective on 1 January 2016 It was not against the rules for Scott to

coconuts My father used to say Little Vijay golf balls don t fall off trees you know so I found some that did! 5 Growing up he played snooker cricket football and the island s most popular sport rugby He is the son of Mohan Singh an airplane technician who also taught golf Growing up he admired the swing of Tom Weiskopf using it as an early model for his own Two years after turning professional Singh won the 1984 Malaysian PGA Championship However his career was plunged into crisis after he was suspended from the Asia Golf Circuit in 1985 over allegations he doctored his scorecard It was alleged that he lowered his score from one over to one under in order to make the cut but Singh denies this saying that in any case it should only have resulted in disqualification from the event rather than a ban After investigation by the Tour of this and other alleged violations proved true John Bender Asian PGA Tour president issued Singh a lifetime ban on Asian PGA Tour play Singh felt he had been more harshly treated because the marker was the son of a VIP in the Indonesian PGA 6 He then took a job at the Keningau Club in Sabah Malaysia before his move to the Miri Golf Club in Sarawak While this was a period of hardship for him he continued to gain experience 7 He saved the money he needed to resurrect his career and began to re enter tournaments In 1988 he teamed up with a sponsor Red Baron which funded a trip to Africa to compete on the now defunct Safari Circuit where he captured his first event the 1988 Nigerian Open locals cheered him loudly At the end of that year he entered the European Tour Qualifying school for the second consecutive year and was successful on this occasion In 1989 Singh won his first European Tour title at the Volvo Open Championship in Italy

Tournament and the Buick Open in 1997 In 1998 Singh was victorious at the PGA Championship at Sahalee Country Club in Sammamish Washington playing a 70 66 67 68 over the four days the 66 tied a course record and earning him his first Major title He followed this up by winning The Masters in 2000 with a three stroke victory over Ernie Els Singh did not win on the PGA Tour in 2001 but finished the year with a Tour best 14 top 10 finishes and was fourth on the money list with $3 440 829 for the year In 2002 he won at the Shell Houston Open at TPC at The Woodlands setting a new tournament 72 hole scoring record with a 266 and at the Tour Championship winning by two strokes over Charles Howell III 2003 proved to be a very successful year for Singh He won four tournaments had 18 top 10 finishes and was the PGA Tour s money leader and had the second highest single season total in PGA Tour history with $7 573 907 beating Tiger Woods by $900 494 though Singh played 27 tournaments compared to Woods 18 tournaments Singh also tied a 9 hole scoring record at the U S Open with a 29 on the back nine of his second round 8 His victories came at the Phoenix Open the EDS Byron Nelson Championship the John Deere Classic and the FUNAI Classic at the Walt Disney World Resort He narrowly lost the vote for the PGA of America s Player of the Year to Tiger Woods However the 2003 season was also spotted with controversy involving Singh surrounding the year s event at the Bank of America Colonial LPGA star Annika Sörenstam became the first woman to play at a PGA Tour event since Babe Zaharias at the 1945 Los Angeles Open Surrounding this fervor Singh was misquoted as having said that Sörenstam didn t belong on the men s tour and that he would not play if he were paired with her What he actually said is that he would not be paired with her because his playing partner was being selected from the past champion s pool Singh later clarified There are guys out there trying to make a living It s not a ladies tour If she wants to play she should—or any other woman for that matter—if they want to play the man s tour they should qualify and play like everybody else Singh began 2004 by winning the AT T Pebble Beach National Pro Am at −16 and winning $954 000 in prize money This was his first win on tour in 2004 and his 16th all time on the PGA Tour It was his 12th consecutive top 10 finish which is two shy of Jack Nicklaus all time record Singh won the final major of 2004 winning the PGA Championship his third major in a three hole aggregate playoff over Justin Leonard and Chris DiMarco Singh was the leader by one shot over Leonard going into the final round but made no birdies in the final round finishing regulation at 67 68 69 76=280 His final round of 76 was the highest winning score by a major champion since 1955 The playoff was a tense affair and Singh s birdie on the first playoff hole his first birdie of the day proved to be the difference On 6 September 2004 Labor Day Singh won the Deutsche Bank Championship in Norton Massachusetts With the win he overtook Tiger Woods at the top of the Official World Golf Ranking ending Woods streak of 264 weeks at the top of the golf world Singh finished the 2004 season with a career best nine victories 18 top 10s and a record $10 905 166 in earnings and was named the PGA Tour s and PGA of America s Player of the Year The former award is decided by a vote of active PGA Tour players Despite picking up a win early in 2005 Singh lost his world number 1 ranking when Tiger Woods won the Ford Championship at Doral on 6 March but just two weeks later he took it back again after notching up top three finishes in three consecutive weeks Following Woods win at the 2005 Masters Singh once again lost his place as World No 1 in the Official World Golf Ranking and finished tied for fifth place In April he became the youngest living person elected to the World Golf Hall of Fame garnering 56% of the ballot Thirty year old Karrie Webb was inducted into the Hall of Fame in October 2005 but Singh remained the youngest living electee as Webb qualified for the Hall without an election process The 19th century great Tom Morris Jr who was elected in 1975 died at age 24 Singh deferred his induction for a year and it took place in October 2006 In 2006 Singh played enough European Tour events to be listed on the European Tour Order of Merit title for the first time since 1995 At the start of the 2007 season Singh won the Mercedes Benz Championship which was the first FedEx Cup event in PGA Tour history This win got Singh his 18th tour win over the age of 40 surpassing Sam Snead as most over 40 wins and making all time over 40 tour winner He won again at The Arnold Palmer Invitational in March but did not win for the rest of the year which turned into a disappointing year for Singh He did not finish in a top ten of a major for the first time in ten years and finished 10th in the FedEx Cup race He went through swing changes during the end of 2007 which resulted in weeks of missed cuts and staying outside the top ten through the Presidents Cup A new swing brought big changes for Singh in 2008 although he had good opportunities at Pebble Beach and Bay Hill he was not competing at a high level for the first half of the year His game was plagued by poor putting for the better part of two years but his season started to turn around with a tie for fifth at the Travelers Championship After missing the cut at The Open Championship Singh won the WGC Bridgestone Invitational in early August for his first win of the year and first World Golf Championship His win had been a relief after missing short putts throughout the week He missed the cut the following two weeks including at Oakland Hills for the PGA Championship and entered the PGA Tour FedEx Cup playoffs ranked 7th in the standings At the first playoff event Singh prevailed for his first FedEx Cup win defeating Sergio García and Kevin Sutherland in a playoff On the first playoff hole García and Singh matched long birdie putts before Singh won with birdie on the second playoff hole Singh was propelled into first place in the FedEx Cup race with three events remaining At the second event of the playoffs he triumphed once again this time at the Deutsche Bank Championship bewildering the field with a five strokes victory and a final round 63 He had won three times in his last five starts and created an almost insurmountable lead in the points race He would not contend in the remaining two events but by playing in both the 2008 FedEx Cup title belonged to Singh His season which looked to be a major disappointment in July turned into an historic year for Singh he won the PGA Tour money list for the third time in his career and he surpassed Harry Cooper for most PGA Tour wins of all time for a non American Singh has won 22 times on the PGA Tour since turning 40 – beating the record previously set by Sam Snead He is the second man to reach $60 million in PGA Tour career earnings after Tiger Woods His 34 career victories are the most on the PGA Tour by a non American player and place him 14th on the all time list He has spent over 540 weeks ranked in the top 10 of the Official World Golf Ranking 9 10 Singh s longevity on the PGA Tour and his number of wins earn him a lifetime exemption on the PGA Tour Kenny Perry another player who found success at a late age is good friends with Singh who calls him Biggie Of Singh Perry said Vijay has always been good to me We talk a lot He wants to know how my family is doing I think the world of him 11 After the 2008 playoffs Singh announced his withdrawal from a couple of Asian Tour events because of a nagging back injury and was advised by doctors to rest 12 He missed two and a half months returning to win Tiger Woods s tournament the Chevron World Challenge at Sherwood Country Club in California in December It was his first victory in the event During the start of the 2009 season Singh announced that he would miss three weeks after undergoing arthroscopic surgery to repair a torn meniscus in his right knee 13 Singh had a mediocre 2009 season with no top 5 finishes and ended the year with his lowest ever ranking on the PGA Tour money list in 68th His poor form continued into 2010 resulting in him being 66th on the PGA Tour money list He dropped out of the top 50 in the world rankings for the first time since the early 1990s After returning from knee surgery Singh started the 2011 season making five out of his first five cuts In February Singh was in contention to win his first PGA Tour Title since 2008 at the Waste Management Phoenix Open in Scottsdale Arizona Despite shooting a final round 66 Singh finished two shots behind Jason Dufner and eventual winner Mark Wilson A couple of weeks later Singh was in contention again this time at the Northern Trust Open at Riviera Country Club However he came up short again not helped by back to back bogeys on holes 12 and 13 He would eventually finish two shots back of the winner Aaron Baddeley although he did secure second spot on his own This early season form however was not enough to secure a spot at the opening World Golf Championship of the year the WGC Accenture Match Play Championship the following week However at number 10 in the 2011 FedEx Cup standings it was just enough to secure a spot at the WGC Cadillac Championship in March On 6 June 2011 Singh missed his tee time for the U S Open qualifying in Columbus Ohio At the time this ended the longest active streak of consecutive majors played by a professional golfer at 67 14 On 30 January 2013 Singh admitted to using deer antler spray while not knowing that it is a banned substance 15 The PGA Tour later dropped its case against him 16 On 8 May 2013 Singh sued the PGA Tour for exposing him to public humiliation and ridicule during a 12 week investigation into his use of deer antler spray On 20 November 2018 the PGA Tour and Singh announced that the lawsuit had been settled The PGA Tour confirmed that it does not believe that Singh intended to gain an unfair advantage over his fellow competitors in this matter Other terms of the settlement were not announced 17 In 2016 he finished second at the Quicken Loans National three strokes behind winner Billy Hurley III In March 2019 Singh shot his way into the final group of the final round of the Honda Classic Singh shot even par to finish sixth three strokes behind winner Keith Mitchell At age 56 he nearly became the oldest winner in

Krishna who is also a professional golfer 21 Controversy surrounded Singh in 2003 before the Bank of America Colonial Annika Sörenstam was scheduled to play the event and Singh was quoted as saying I hope she misses the cut because she doesn t belong out here He later said that the substance of his interview to an Associated Press reporter was that she would be displacing some other struggling male player for whom he had his sympathies However the media focused on this statement Golf Digest wrote that Singh had become pro golf s bad guy After Singh s win at the Masters Ernie Els took issue with some of the negative press his friend received He wrote an article in Sports Illustrated to defend him saying Golf should be proud of Vijay Singh Later Els said of Singh He s a wonderful guy I ve known him for the better part of 10 years now He s a great competitor I think people have a misconception of Vijay He s a really good guy 22 In May 2005 Singh was appointed a goodwill ambassador for Fiji He said that he did not expect anything in return from the Fijian government for representing his country At a press conference on 18 May 2005 Singh commented on what he said was a deterioration

World War II 4 He played for Great Britain in the Ryder Cup in 1935 1937 and 1949 and won two of his five matches Burton was born on a farm at Winter Hill in Darwen Lancashire The Burton family lived next to the Darwen Golf Club before moving to Lynwood Avenue Richard was the youngest but tallest of three boys and with his brothers Tom and John used to watch members playing past their farm which was just above the clubhouse As they had no golf equipment themselves they had to make do with hitting bobbins from their mother s workbasket around the farm with an old walking stick Eventually the brothers were given a few old hickory shafted clubs Burton had started out as a caddie at Darwen Golf Club before applying for the position of greensman After a number of years in 1929 he then replaced his brother John as the club professional when John moved to the Hillside Club in Southport Three years later in 1932 Burton was appointed the professional at Hooton Golf Club which is now known as Ellesmere Port Golf Club which gave him more opportunity to play competitive golf Also around this time Burton s remaining brother Tom was appointed the club professional at Darwen to complete a unique trio for the Burton family In 1934 Burton won the Northern Professional Championship the first of many titles the following year he collected the Dunlop Northern Tournament and made his first appearance in the Ryder Cup for Great Britain He was also runner up in the Dunlop Southport Tournament semi finalist in the News of the World Match Play and third in the Scottish Penfold

George s in Kent eight shots behind Reg Whitcombe At the 1939 Open Championship at the Old Course at St Andrews his first three rounds of 70 72 and 77 put in him contention Burton started his fourth round already knowing that he needed to score 72 or better to win the title as his rivals had completed their rounds He did not start well as he 3 putted at the first hole but he recovered and carded two birdies in the last three holes on the front nine to go out in 35 and leave him in a great position On the second part of the course Burton played cautiously at the treacherous 14th for a five and avoided the sandtraps on the 17th He came to the last needing a four to win and hit a huge drive then pitched to 15 feet His putt looked like it might race past the hole but as Burton walked after it it dropped in the hole for a closing birdie A 71 left him on 290 to win by two shots from Johnny Bulla Burton was the sixth British winner in a row since Denny Shute had won the last Open at St Andrews in 1933 In 1939 apart from his Open triumph Burton also won the True Temper Foursomes Tournament partnering Fred Robson and lost in a playoff to Alf Padgham for the Silver King Tournament He won the News Chronicle Tournament at Hollingbury Park Golf Club in 1949 with a record aggregate for 72 holes at the time with 266 strokes Burton s only book named Length with Discretion was published in 1939 shortly after his Open triumph through Hutchinson Co Publishers It was a golf instruction in 13 chapters with illustrations 5 However a few weeks after his Open triumph Burton was serving in the RAF and never really had the opportunity to capitalise on his success The fairways at the Old Course at St Andrews ended up being used by the RAF as runways When asked later in life if he regretted not being able capitalise on the Open Championship win he replied I was lucky enough…a lot of those who watched me at St Andrews also went off to war and they never came back Some of my friends didn t make it either I did Burton also helped the war effort by raising money for the Red Cross by playing charity matches with Henry Cotton who was also serving in the RAF In the spring of 1946 he wrote to the Royal and Ancient Dear Sirs Please find enclosed my fee of five guineas for this year s Open I will bring the trophy back when I come Burton is still celebrated at Sale Golf Club Every year the club holds the Richard Burton Trophy on the weekend of the Open Championship and have a display including the putter he used to win the Open In later life he was the club professional at Coombe Hill Golf Club in Kingston Surrey His assistant there was Neil Coles Burton once bet a rival that he could beat him using only a putter He lost his bet but only on the 18th hole When Burton played fourball with other members rather than pair up with a member he would play against all three and give full handicaps He still won more often than not Also Burton reputedly hit the 120 yard 17th hole with every club in his bag including the putter Burton died in hospital on 30 January 1974 after a long illness 6 Note Burton never played in the Masters Tournament or the PGA Championship

https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Hogan,Golf,,,William Ben Hogan August 13 1912 – July 25 1997 was an American professional golfer who is generally considered to be one of the greatest players in the history of the game 1 He is notable for his profound influence on golf swing theory and his legendary ball striking ability 2 3 4 Hogan s nine career professional major championships tie him with Gary Player for fourth all time trailing only Jack Nicklaus 18 Tiger Woods 15 and Walter Hagen 11 He is one of only five players to have won all four majors the Masters Tournament The Open Championship despite only playing once the U S Open and the PGA Championship The other four are Nicklaus Woods Player and Gene Sarazen Hogan s first major win came at age 34 Hogan was born in Stephenville Texas the third and youngest child of Chester and Clara Williams Hogan His father was a blacksmith and the family lived ten miles 16 km southwest in Dublin until 1921 when they moved seventy miles 110 km northeast to Fort Worth When Hogan was nine years old in 1922 his father Chester committed suicide with a self inflicted gunshot at the family home By some accounts Chester committed suicide in front of him which some including Hogan biographer James Dodson have cited as the cause of his introverted personality in later years 5 The family incurred financial difficulties after his father s suicide and the children took jobs to help their seamstress mother make ends meet Older brother Royal quit school at age 14 to deliver office supplies by bicycle and nine year old Ben sold newspapers after school at the nearby train station A tip from a friend led him to caddying at age eleven at Glen Garden Country Club a nine hole course seven miles 11 km to the south One of his fellow caddies at Glen Garden was Byron Nelson later a tour rival The two would tie for the lead at the annual Christmas caddie tournament in December 1927 when both were fifteen Nelson sank a 30 foot 9 m putt to tie on the ninth and final hole Instead of sudden death they played another nine holes Nelson sank another substantial putt on the final green to win by a stroke The following spring Nelson was granted the only junior membership offered by the members of Glen Garden Club rules did not allow caddies age 16 and older so after August 1928 Hogan took his game to three scrubby daily fee courses Katy Lake Worth Hills and Z Boaz Hogan dropped out of Central High School during the final semester of his senior year He turned pro in the golf industry six months shy of his 18th birthday at the Texas Open in San Antonio in late January 1930 Hogan met Valerie Fox in Sunday school in Fort Worth in the mid 1920s and they reacquainted in 1932 when he landed a low paying club pro job in Cleburne where her family had moved They married in April 1935 at her parents home Hogan s early years as a pro were very difficult he went broke more than once He did not win his first tournament as an individual until March 1940 6 7 when he won three consecutive events in North Carolina at age 27 8 9 Although it took a decade for Hogan to secure his first victory his wife Valerie believed in him and this helped see him through the tough years when he battled a hook that he later cured Despite finishing 13th on the money list in 1938 Hogan took an assistant pro job at Century Country Club in Purchase New York He worked at Century as an assistant and then as the head pro until 1941 when he took the head pro job at Hershey Country Club in Hershey Pennsylvania During Hogan s prime years of 1938 through 1959 he won 63 professional golf tournaments despite the interruption of his career by World War II and a near fatal car accident Hogan served in the U S Army Air Forces from March 1943 to June 1945 he was stationed locally at Fort Worth and became a utility pilot with the rank of lieutenant Driving home to Fort Worth after a Monday playoff loss at the 1949 Phoenix Open 10 Hogan and his wife Valerie survived a head on collision with a Greyhound bus east of Van Horn Texas On the morning of Wednesday February 2 Hogan had reduced his speed in the limited visibility ground fog the bus was attempting to pass another vehicle on a narrow bridge which left no place to avoid the crash Hogan threw himself across Valerie in order to protect her He would have been killed had he not done so because the steering column punctured the driver s seat of their new Cadillac sedan 11 12 This accident left Hogan age 36 with a double fracture of the pelvis a fractured collar bone a left ankle fracture a chipped rib and near fatal blood clots he would suffer lifelong circulation problems and other physical limitations His doctors said he might never walk again let alone play golf competitively While Hogan was in the hospital in El Paso his life was endangered by a blood clot problem that led doctors to tie off the vena cava He left the hospital on the first of April 59 days after the accident and returned to Fort Worth by train 13 14 Hogan regained his strength by extensive walking and resumed his golf activities in November 1949 He returned to the PGA Tour to start the 1950 season at the Los Angeles Open where he tied with Sam Snead over 72 holes but lost the 18 hole playoff held over a week later due to course conditions 15 16 The win at Carnoustie was only a part of Hogan s watershed 1953 season a year in which he won five of the six tournaments he entered including three major championships a feat known as the Triple Crown of Golf 17 It still stands among the greatest single seasons in the history of professional golf Hogan 40 was unable to enter—and possibly win—the 1953 PGA Championship to complete the Grand Slam because its play July 1–7 overlapped the play of The Open at Carnoustie July 6–10 which he won It was the only time that a golfer had won three major professional championships in a year until Tiger Woods won the final three majors in 2000 and the first in 2001 Hogan often declined to play in the PGA Championship he skipped it more and more often as his career wore on There were two reasons for this First the PGA Championship was until 1958 a match play event and Hogan s particular skill was shooting a number —meticulously planning and executing a strategy to achieve a score for a round on a particular course even to the point of leaving out the 7 iron in the U S Open at Merion saying there are no 7 iron shots at Merion Second the PGA required several days of 36 holes per day competition and after his 1949 auto accident Hogan struggled to manage more than 18 holes a day After the win at Carnoustie Hogan and his wife Valerie were passengers on the SS United States westbound to New York City where he received a ticker tape parade down Broadway on July 21 18 19 Ben Hogan is widely acknowledged to be one of the greatest ball strikers who ever played golf Although he had a formidable record with 64 PGA tour victories it is Hogan s ball striking ability that mostly underpins his modern reputation Hogan was known to practice more than any of his contemporary golfers and is said to have invented practice On this matter Hogan himself said You hear stories about me beating my brains out practicing but I was enjoying myself I couldn t wait to get up in the morning so I could hit balls When I m hitting the ball where I want hard and crisply it s a joy that very few people experience 20 He was also one of the first players to match particular clubs to yardages or reference points around the course such as bunkers or trees in order to improve his distance control Hogan thought that an individual s golf swing was in the dirt and that mastering it required plenty of practice and repetition He is also known to have spent years contemplating the golf swing trying a range of theories and methods before arriving at the finished method which brought him his greatest period of success The young Hogan was badly afflicted by hooking the golf ball Although slight of build at 5 8½ and 145 pounds 21 – attributes that earned him the nickname Bantam which he thoroughly disliked – he was long off the tee early in his career Like many professional golfers of his day he competed in long drive contests as well as matchplay and strokeplay events It has been alleged that Hogan used a strong grip with hands more the right of the club grip in tournament play prior to his accident in 1949 despite often practicing with a weak grip with the back of the left wrist facing the target and that this limited his success or at least his reliability up to that date 22 Jacobs alleges that Byron Nelson told him this information and furthermore that Hogan developed and used the strong grip as a boy in order to be able to hit the ball as far as bigger stronger contemporaries This strong grip is what resulted in Hogan hitting the odd disastrous snap hook Hogan s late swing produced the famed Hogan Fade ball flight lower than usual for a great player and from left to right This ball flight was the result of his using a draw type swing in conjunction with a weak grip a combination that all but negated the chance of hitting a hook Hogan played and practiced golf with only bare hands i e without wearing gloves Moe Norman did the same playing and practicing without gloves The two were arguably the greatest ball strikers golf has ever known even Tiger Woods quoted them as the only players ever to have owned their swings in that they had total control of it and as a result the ball s flight 23 In May 1967 the editor of Cary Middlecoff s 1974 book The Golf Swing watched every shot that 54 year old Hogan hit in the Colonial National Invitational in Fort Worth Texas Hogan shot 281 for a third place tie with George Archer Of the 281 shots 141 were taken in reaching the greens Of the 141 139 were rated from well executed to superbly executed The remaining two were a drive that missed the fairway by some 5 yards and a 5 iron to a par 3 hole that missed the green by about the same distance It was difficult if not impossible to conceive of anybody hitting the ball better over a four day span 24 In the spring of 1953 Hogan announced he had discovered a secret that made his swing nearly automatic 25 There are many theories as to its exact nature The earliest theory is that the secret was a special wrist movement known as cupping under This information was revealed in a 1955 Life magazine article However many believed Hogan did not reveal all that he knew at the time It has since been alleged in Golf Digest magazine and by Jody Vasquez in his book Afternoons With Mr Hogan that the second element of Hogan s secret was the way in which he used his right knee to initiate the swing and that this right knee movement was critical to the correct operation of the wrist Hogan revealed later in life that the secret involved cupping the left wrist at the top of the backswing and using a weaker left hand grip thumb more on top of the grip as opposed to on the right side Hogan did this to prevent himself from ever hooking the ball off the tee By positioning his hands in this manner he ensured that the club face would be slightly open upon impact creating a fade left to right ball flight as opposed to a draw or hook right to left ball flight Many believed that although he played right handed as an adult Hogan was actually left handed In his book Five Lessons in the chapter entitled The Grip Hogan said I was born left handed that was the normal way for me to do things I was switched over to doing things right handed when I was a boy but I started golf as a left hander because the first club I ever came into possession of an old five iron was a left handed stick This belief also seemed to be corroborated by Hogan himself in his earlier book Power Golf However some mystery still remains about this since Hogan in subsequent interviews said that the belief of his being left handed was actually a myth noted in what was probably his last video interview and in his 1987 Golf Magazine interview In these interviews Hogan said that he was indeed a right handed player who early on practiced played with a left hand club that had been given to him because it was all that he had and that it was this issue that brought about the myth that he was left handed This may be the reason that his early play with right handed equipment found him using a cross handed grip right hand at the end of the club left hand below it In The Search for the Perfect Golf Swing researchers Cochran and Stobbs held the opinion that a left handed person playing right handed would be prone to hook the ball Hy Peskin a staff photographer for Sports Illustrated took a famous photo of Ben Hogan playing a 1 iron shot to the green at the 72nd hole of the 1950 U S Open 26 It was ranked by Sports Illustrated as one of the greatest sports photographs of the 20th century 27 Hogan believed that a solid repeatable golf swing involved only a few essential elements which when performed correctly and in sequence were the essence of the swing His book Five Lessons The Modern Fundamentals of Golf written with Herbert Warren Wind is perhaps the most widely read golf tutorial ever written although Harvey Penick s Little Red Book would also have a claim to that title and the principles therein are often parroted by modern swing gurus In the Five Lessons Hogan breaks down the swing into four parts The Fundamentals The Grip Stance and Posture and The Swing Hogan explains that the average golfer underestimates himself He believes that beginners place too much emphasis on the long game If you have a correct powerful and repeating swing then you can shoot in the 70s The average golfer is entirely capable of building a repeating swing and breaking 80 28 Through years of trial and error Ben has developed techniques that have proved themselves under various types of pressure Hogan says Good golf begins with a good grip 28 Without a good grip one cannot play to his or her potential The grip is important because it is the only direct physical contact you have with the ball via your golf club A bad grip can cause dipping of the hands at the top of the swing and a decrease in club head speed This can cause a loss of power and accuracy The following describes the perfect golf grip in the eyes of Mr Hogan With the back of your left hand facing the target place the club in the left hand so that 1 The shaft is pressed up under the muscular pad at the inside heel of the palm and 2 The shaft also lies directly across the top joint of the forefinger 28 Crook the forefinger around the shaft and you will discover that you can lift the club and maintain a fairly firm grip on it by supporting it just with the muscles of that finger and the muscles of the pad of the palm 28 Now just close the left hand close the fingers before you close the thumb and the club will be just where it should be 28 To gain a real acquaintance with this preparatory guide to correct gripping I would suggest practicing it five or 10 minutes a day for a week until it begins to become second nature 28 To obtain the proper grip with the right hand hold it somewhat extended with the palm facing your target Now your left hand is already correctly affixed place the club in your right hand so that the shaft lies across the top joint of the four fingers and definitely below the palm 28 The right hand is a finger grip The two fingers which should apply most of the pressure are the two middle fingers 28 Now with the club held firmly on the fingers of your right hand simply fold your right hand over your left thumb 28 The right stance not only allows for proper alignment but also for a balanced swing prepared usage of the proper muscles and the maximum strength and control over your swing We align our body to the target only after we have aligned the club head to the target A proper stance starts with your feet being aligned at the target followed by your knees hips and shoulders Your feet should be shoulder width apart your front foot should be slightly opened towards the target and your back foot should be perpendicular to the target As you increase in club your stance should widen for further stability Your shoulders will be naturally open to the target line because your arms are not at equal length while holding the club Make sure to close your shoulders slightly to stay aligned with the target line The proper stance affects how controlled the backswing is governs the amount of hip turn in the backswing and allows for the hips to clear through the downswing Your front arm should be extended at all times to allow the club to travel in its maximum arc The elbows should be tucked in not stuck out from the body At address the left elbow should point directly at the left hipbone and the right elbow should point directly at the right hipbone Furthermore there should be a sense of fixed jointness between the two forearms and the wrists and it should be maintained throughout the swing 28 You should bend your knees from the thighs down As your knees bend the upper part of the trunk remains normally erect just as it does when you sit down in a chair In golf the sit down motion is more like lowering yourself onto a spectator sports stick Think of the seat of the stick as being about two inches or so below your buttocks 28 Hogan advocates the use of a waggle not only because it helps you loosen your muscles but also because it allows for your hands and arms to remember where to go for the first part of your backswing The angle of the swing should feel like you are swinging under a slanting plane of glass The glass has a hole for your head while it rests on your shoulders and touches the ground on top of your ball Also the backswing should be slightly steeper than the downswing At the top of your backswing your back should be facing the target On the backswing the order of movement goes like this hands arms shoulders hips 28 Actually the hands start the club head back a split second before the arms start back And the arms begin their movement a split second before the shoulders begin to turn 28 Just before your hands reach hip level the shoulders as they turn automatically start pulling the hips around As the hips begin to turn they pull the left leg in to the right 28 When you have turned your shoulders all the way your back should face squarely toward your target 28 When you finish your backswing your chin should be hitting against the top of your left shoulder 28 As you begin the backswing you must restrain your hips from moving until the turning of the shoulders starts to pull the hips around…It is this increased tension that unwinds the upper part of the body It unwinds the shoulder the arms and the hands in that order the correct order It helps the swing so much it makes it almost automatic 28 If he executes his backswing properly as his arms are approaching hip level they should be parallel with the plane and they should remain parallel with the plane just beneath the glass till they reach the top of the backswing At the top of his backswing his left arm should be extended at the exact same angle to the ball as the glass 28 Hogan believes the second part of the swing the downswing is initiated by the hips starting to turn A baseball player throws a ball by transferring his weight and rotates his hips Then his shoulders and arm follow after Hogan thinks that the downswing is very similar to this action The downswing is at a slightly shallower angle and therefore the arms and hands should come from the inside out on the downswing The club head reaches its maximum speed not at impact but right after when both arms are fully extended At impact the back of the left hand faces toward your target The wrist bone is definitely raised It points to the target and at the moment the ball is contacted it is out in front nearer to the target than any part of the hand 28 At impact the right arm is still bent slightly 28 At that point just beyond impact where both arms are straight and extended the club head reaches its maximum speed 28 The hips lead the shoulders all the way on the downswing 28 The Five Lessons were initially released as a five part series in Sports Illustrated magazine beginning with the issue of March 11 1957 29 It was compiled and printed in book form later that year and is currently in its 64th printing Even today it continues to maintain a place at or near the top of the Amazon com golf book sales rankings The book was co authored by Herbert Warren Wind and illustrated by artist Anthony Ravielli Hogan is widely acknowledged to have been one of the finest ball strikers that ever played the game Hogan s ball striking has also been described as being of near miraculous caliber by other very knowledgeable observers such as Jack Nicklaus who only saw him play some years after his prime Nicklaus once responded to the question Is Tiger Woods the best ball striker you have ever seen with No no Ben Hogan easily 30 Further testimony to Hogan s and Moe Norman s status among top golfers is provided by Tiger Woods who recently when said that he wished to own his golf swing in the same way as Moe Norman and Hogan had Woods claimed that this pair were the only players ever to have owned their swings in that they had total control of it and as a result of the ball s flight 23 By most accounts Ben Hogan was the best golfer of his era and still stands as one of the greatest of all time The Hawk possessed fierce determination and an iron will which combined with his unquestionable golf skills formed an aura that could intimidate opponents into competitive submission In Scotland Hogan was known as The Wee Ice Man or in some versions Wee Ice Mon a moniker earned during his famous British Open victory at Carnoustie in 1953 31 It is a reference to his steely and seemingly nerveless demeanor itself a product of a golf swing he had built that was designed to perform better the more pressure he put it under Hogan rarely spoke during competition and mostly kept to himself Hogan was also highly respected by fellow competitors for his superb course management skills During his peak years he rarely if ever attempted a shot in competition which he had not thoroughly honed in practice Although his ball striking was perhaps the greatest ever Hogan s putting skills are thought to have been below average though he was capable of putting very well Solid and sometimes spectacular in his early and peak years Hogan by his later years deteriorated to the point of being an often poor putter by professional standards particularly on slow greens The majority of his putting problems developed after his 1949 car accident which nearly blinded his left eye and impaired his depth perception Toward the end of his career he often stood over the ball inordinately long before drawing his putter back While he suffered from the yips in his later years 32 Hogan was known as an effective putter from mid to short range on quick U S Open style surfaces at times during his career Ben Hogan won ten tournaments in 1948 alone including the U S Open at Riviera Country Club a course known as Hogan s Alley because of his success there His 8 under par score in 1948 set a U S Open record that was matched only by Jack Nicklaus in 1980 Hale Irwin in 1990 and Lee Janzen in 1993 It was not broken until Tiger Woods shot 12 under par in 2000 Jim Furyk also shot 8 under par in the 2003 Rory McIlroy set the current record with 16 under par in 2011 which was matched by Brooks Koepka in 2017 Hogan remains the only player to win at least 10 PGA tour events in a year twice 13 in 1946 10 in 1948 Hogan owns the longest streaks of consecutive major attempts finishing in both the top 5 with 12 1940 1947 the top 10 with 18 1948 1956 Hogan is the only player to win as many as 8 majors in as few as 11 attempts 1948 1953 Hogan is the only player to finish in the top 2 in more than 15 PGA tour events 2 different years 16 in 1941 20 in 1946 Hogan owns the longest streak of consecutive U S Open attempts finishing in the top 10 with 16 1940 1960 The next longest streak is 7 Hogan is one of only 2 players to ever win 3 consecutive U S Opens in 3 attempts the other is Willie Anderson Hogan finished top 10 and scored UNDER 290 in 12 consecutive U S Open attempts 1941 1956 which is the longest such streak in Open history He did it on 12 different courses and won 5 times Despite technological advances in the game which always lowers scores the next longest streak remains just 4 To further put this incomparable sports achievement into perspective consider the following In the 1970 US Open Nicklaus Palmer Player all failed to break 300! AND Tiger Woods during this ultimate technological century failed to finish top 10 break 290 4 times 2004 06 13 15 between age 21 39 while finishing top 10 only 8 total times during his career Hogan is the only player to win 3 majors in 3 consecutive starts 2 different times 1950 51 1953 All these achievements of course include the Hale America National Open Colonial Country Club in Fort Worth a modern PGA Tour tournament venue is also known as Hogan s Alley and may have the better claim to the nickname as he won its tour event five times It was his home course after his retirement and he was an active member of Colonial as well for many years The sixth hole at Carnoustie a par five on which Hogan took a famously difficult line off the tee during each of his rounds in the 1953 Open Championship has also recently been renamed Hogan s Alley Prior to the 1949 accident Hogan never truly captured the hearts of his galleries despite being one of the best golfers of his time Perhaps this was due to his perceived cold and aloof on course persona But when Hogan shocked and amazed the golf world by returning to tournament golf only eleven months after his accident and took second place in the 1950 Los Angeles Open after a playoff loss to Sam Snead he was cheered on by ecstatic fans His legs simply were not strong enough to carry his heart any longer famed sportswriter Grantland Rice said of Hogan s near miss However he proved to his critics and to himself especially that he could still win by completing his famous comeback five months later defeating Lloyd Mangrum and George Fazio in an 18 hole playoff at Merion near Philadelphia to win his second U S Open title Hogan went on to achieve what is perhaps the greatest sporting accomplishment in history limping to twelve more PGA Tour wins including six majors before retiring In 1951 Hogan entered just five events but won three of them the Masters U S Open and World Championship of Golf and finished second and fourth in his other two starts He finished fourth on that season s money list barely $6 000 behind the season s official money list leader Lloyd Mangrum who played over twenty events That year also saw the release of a biopic starring Glenn Ford as Hogan called Follow the Sun The Ben Hogan Story 33 He even received a ticker tape parade in New York City in 1953 upon his return from winning the British Open the only time he played the event With that victory Hogan became just the second player after Gene Sarazen to win all four of the modern major championships—the Masters U S Open British Open and PGA Championship Hogan remains the only player to win the Masters U S Open and British Open in the same calendar year 1953 His 14 under par at the 1953 Masters set a record that stood for a dozen years as of 2018 he remains one of just twelve Jack Nicklaus Raymond Floyd Ben Crenshaw Tiger Woods David Duval Phil Mickelson Charl Schwartzel Jordan Spieth Justin Rose Rickie Fowler and Patrick Reed to have recorded such a low score in the tournament In 1967 at age 54 Hogan shot a record 30 on the back nine at the Masters the record stood until 1992 In 1945 Hogan set a PGA Tour record for a 72 hole event at the Portland Open Invitational by shooting 27 under par The record stood until 1998 when it was broken by John Huston it has since been surpassed by nine others including most recently Phil Mickelson s 28 under in the 2013 Waste Management Phoenix Open 34 Hogan never competed on the Senior PGA Tour as that circuit did not exist until he was in his late sixties According to his PGA Tour profile 35 Hogan earned just $332 516 in official PGA events however a 2021 study concluded that Hogan s tournament performances could have earned him $91 8M if he had played in the modern era 36 Many supporters of Hogan and some golf historians feel that his victory at the Hale America Open in 1942 should be counted as his fifth U S Open and 10th major championship since the tournament was to be a substitute for the Open after its cancellation by the USGA The Hale America National Open was held in the same time slot and was run like the U S Open with more than 1 500 entries local qualifying at 69 sites and sectional qualifying at most major cities The top players who were not away fighting in World War II participated and the largest purse of the year was awarded Included in the field were all the very top players of the day including Byron Nelson Gene Sarazen Jimmy Demaret Lloyd Mangrum defending Open champ Craig Wood The only player of that level who did not play was Sam Snead but the field did also include Bobby Jones who had competed in his own Masters event in April of that year 37 38 39 Following his most successful season Hogan started his golf club company in the fall of 1953 in Fort Worth Production began in the summer of 1954 with clubs targeted toward the better player Always a perfectionist Hogan is said to have ordered the entire first

https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Grout,Golf,,,John Frederick Jack Grout March 24 1910 – May 13 1989 was an American professional golfer who competed on the PGA Tour from 1931 to 1953 Though he taught many Hall of Fame players he is best known as the first and only golf teacher of Jack Nicklaus 1 He was inducted into the Golf Magazine World Golf Teachers Hall of Fame in 2016 Grout was born in Oklahoma City Oklahoma His golf career began in 1918 as a caddie at the old Oklahoma City Golf Country Club In 1927 at the age of seventeen he was named the golf professional at Edgemere Country Club in Oklahoma City On October 30 1929 just one day after the stock market collapsed he was elected to membership in the PGA Several months later in February 1930 he and his older brother Dick moved from Oklahoma City to Fort Worth Texas There the older Grout began working as the head professional at Glen Garden Country Club It was at Glen Garden where Jack Grout employed as his brother s assistant became friends and playing partners with 18 year old Byron Nelson and 17 year old Ben Hogan Both would later become two of the top players in golf history 2 Grout made his PGA Tour début on December 18 1931 playing in the Pasadena Open at Brookside Park Golf Course 3 He remained a regular member on the pro circuit until 1945 Though he had one of the finest swings in the game he was never among the Tour s top money winners because of extreme near sightedness as well as having a chronic back condition In 1941 Grout s unofficial tournament earnings totaled over $4 200 According to PGA Tour statistics he ranked #25 with $2 389 in official money His best finish came in the St Augustine Professional Amateur where he and his partner Frank Allan placed second to Sam Snead and his partner Wilford Wehrle Other top ten finishes that year included third tie Hershey Open fourth tie Atlantic City Open fifth Thomasville Open seventh tie Harlingen Open eighth tie Florida West Coast Open ninth tie Miami Open and ninth tie in the PGA Championship at Cherry Hills in Denver Colorado Again in 1942 he ranked #25 on the PGA Tour in official money 4 In 1943 according to PGA Tour Player Rankings he was ranked #18 5 Grout departed Fort Worth in early 1937 and spent the next three years at Hershey Country Club in Hershey Pennsylvania as an assistant to Henry Picard At that time Picard was one of the top players on the tour Through Grout s association with Picard he was exposed to new theories on golf technique that had been advanced in the 1920s and 1930s by Alex Morrison a controversial West Coast professional It was Morrison s coaching which primarily took Picard to stardom 6 In many respects Morrison who courted publicity was well ahead of his time So in his own quiet way was Grout By 1950 at Scioto Country Club in Columbus Ohio when he started to work with the ten year old novice Jack Nicklaus he had arrived at a very sound understanding of the golf swing – a plexus of Morrison s ideas Picard s ideas and his own 7 As Grout saw it his Six Fundamentals were a base on which to build an outstanding swing He felt strongly that the absolute first thing you must have is a Good Grip on the club a grip that will naturally unconsciously deliver the club face square to the target at impact Second Set Up Correctly because that important maneuver determines how you will swing the club Third maintain a Steady Head position throughout the swing His fourth fundamental was Proper Footwork because it promotes both good balance and full swinging 8 The basis of footwork is rolling your ankles correctly while keeping your knees flexed at all times Fundamental 5 called for Full Extension A golfer should try to develop the widest possible arc by making a full shoulder turn and fully extending his arms on the backswing and downswing Grout s sixth fundamental was the importance of having Quiet Hands passive hands at the start of the downswing While the feet actually initiate the downswing the arms not the hands must swing the club through the ball 9 Asked about putting later in his career Grout stated that if he had it to do over he would have taught Nicklaus to putt cross handed Nicklaus later quoted Grout and said that golfers new to the game should learn to putt left hand low right handed golfers Grout and Nicklaus worked together as coach and student from the time Nicklaus began golf in 1950 They developed a unique arrangement where Nicklaus would visit Grout at the start of each new season to review fundamentals virtually from scratch Nicklaus would consult Grout periodically for tune ups and minor modifications away from the Tour if he was struggling for form but Nicklaus primarily stayed with the knowledge he acquired with Grout 10 Grout made annual visits to the Masters U S Open and PGA Championship but seldom instructed Nicklaus at major tournament sites Grout believed in self sufficiency that a golfer had to be in charge of his own swing His conviction was that a golfer could achieve his full potential only by being self reliant He is quoted as saying The golfer who must fall back on a teacher every time any little thing sours in his game cannot but have a limited future 11 Nicklaus would recall his teacher this way He knew the golf swing probably as well as any instructor ever has But I think his greatest gift to his students was his belief in them and his ability to get them to believe in themselves He wanted you not only to be skilled technically but also to be so confident of your skills that you could identify and fix your own swing flaws even in the heat of battle even without him there by your side In other words Jack Grout worked to be dispensable He wanted his students to be able to function at the highest level without him 12 Grout completed his PGA Tour career by playing in the 1956 U S Open at Oak Hill Country Club in Rochester New York In October 1961 he moved his family to Miami Beach Florida where he became pro at La Gorce Country Club Grout held that position until 1974 when at the age of 64 he decided to say farewell to the day to day responsibilities of a head professional and accept the invitation of Jack Nicklaus to become the teacher in chief and professional emeritus at his Muirfield Village Golf Club in Dublin Ohio 13 During the late 1970s and 1980s Grout held wintertime teaching professional positions at Frenchman s Creek Country Club in Palm Beach Gardens Florida and later at The Loxahatchee Club in Jupiter Florida Throughout his long career Grout played a pivotal role in the development of many fine players His reputation for having a non irritating manner an uncanny eye in spotting flaws and a knack for transmitting simple solutions to what seemed like complicated problems attracted such golfers as Jack Nicklaus Raymond Floyd Tommy Aaron Joe Turnesa Dow Finsterwald Ben Crenshaw Grier Jones DeWitt Weaver Marty Fleckman J C Snead Gibby Gilbert Jerry Heard Roger Maltbie Tom Purtzer Lanny Wadkins Bruce Devlin Jim Colbert Butch Baird George Burns III Jerry McGee Fred Ridley Steve Melnyk and Olin Browne 12 Additionally Grout peered at the swings of quite a few LPGA Tour players including Barbara Romack Jo Ann Prentice Maria Astrologes Beth Stone Kathy Cornelius Kathy Farrer Dianne Dailey Silvia Bertolaccini Sandra Spuzich and Sally Little 14 Grout continued to teach and promote the game until his death in Tequesta Florida at the age of 79 He and Bonnie Ann Fox his wife of 46 years had four children and six grandchildren He is interred beside her in Riverside Memorial Park in Tequesta Florida Furthermore Jack Grout came from a fine family of golfers His older brother Dick played in the 1926 PGA Championship at Salisbury Golf Links Westbury New York and the 1929 U S Open at Winged Foot Golf Club in Mamaroneck New York Also Dick won the Oklahoma Open in 1927 and 1929 His younger brother Raymond Dutch played in the 1934 U S Open at Merion Golf Club in Ardmore Pennsylvania and later that same year won the Oklahoma State Open Match Play Championship His youngest sister Jenny was one of the greatest female golfers in Oklahoma history She won both the state high school girls championship in 1934 and the state amateur championship in 1937 15 In addition Grout s youngest son Dick was a contestant in the 1979 U S Open at Inverness Club in Toledo Ohio Jack

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf,Golf,,,Golf is a club and ball sport in which players use various clubs to hit balls into a series of holes on a course in as few strokes as possible Golf unlike most ball games cannot and does not utilize a standardized playing area and coping with the varied terrains encountered on different courses is a key part of the game The game at the usual level is played on a course with an arranged progression of 18 holes though recreational courses can be smaller often having nine holes Each hole on the course must contain a teeing ground to start from and a putting green containing the actual hole or cup mw parser output frac{white space nowrap} mw parser output frac num mw parser output frac den{font size 80% line height 0 vertical align super} mw

diameter There are other standard forms of terrain in between such as the fairway rough long grass bunkers or sand traps and various hazards water rocks but each hole on a course is unique in its specific layout and arrangement Golf is played for the lowest number of strokes by an individual known as stroke play or the lowest score on the most individual holes in a complete round by an individual or team known as match play Stroke play is the most commonly seen format at all levels but most especially at the elite level The modern game of golf originated in 15th century Scotland The 18 hole round was created at the Old Course at St Andrews in 1764 Golf s first major and the world s oldest tournament in existence is The Open Championship also known as the British Open which was first played in 1860 at the Prestwick Golf Club in Ayrshire Scotland This is one of the four major championships in men s professional golf the other three being played in the United States The Masters the U S Open and the PGA Championship While the modern game of golf originated in 15th century Scotland the game s ancient origins are unclear and much debated Some historians 3 trace the sport back to the Roman game of paganica in which participants used a bent stick to hit a stuffed leather ball One theory asserts that paganica spread throughout Europe as the Romans conquered most of the continent during the first century BC and eventually evolved into the modern game 4 Others cite chuiwan 捶丸 chui means striking and wan means small ball 5 as the progenitor a Chinese game played between the eighth and fourteenth centuries 6 A Ming Dynasty scroll by the artist Youqiu dating back to 1368 entitled The Autumn Banquet shows a member of the Chinese Imperial court swinging what appears to be a golf club at a small ball with the aim of sinking it into a hole 5 The game is thought to have been introduced into Europe during the Middle Ages 7 Another early game that resembled modern golf was known as cambuca in England and chambot in France 7 The Persian game chowkan is another possible ancient origin albeit being more polo like In addition kolven a game involving a ball and curved bats was played annually in Loenen Netherlands beginning in 1297 to commemorate the capture of the assassin of Floris V a year earlier The modern game originated in Scotland where the first written record of golf is James II s banning of the game in 1457 as an unwelcome distraction to learning archery 8 James IV lifted the ban in 1502 when he became a golfer himself with golf clubs first recorded in 1503–1504 For golf clubbes and balles to the King that he playit with 9 To many golfers the Old Course at St Andrews a links course dating to before 1574 is considered to be a site of pilgrimage 10 In 1764 the standard 18 hole golf course was created at St Andrews when members modified the course from 22 to 18 holes 11 Golf is documented as being played on Musselburgh Links East Lothian Scotland as early as 2 March 1672 which is certified as the oldest golf course in the world by Guinness World Records 12 13 The oldest surviving rules of golf were compiled in March 1744 for the Company of Gentlemen Golfers later renamed The Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers which was played at Leith Scotland 14 The world s oldest golf tournament in existence and golf s first major is The Open Championship which was first played on 17 October 1860 at Prestwick Golf Club in Ayrshire Scotland with Scottish golfers winning the earliest majors 15 Two Scotsmen from Dunfermline John Reid and Robert Lockhart first demonstrated golf in the U S by setting up a hole in an orchard in 1888 with Reid setting up America s first golf club the same year Saint Andrew s Golf Club in Yonkers New York 16 A golf course consists of either 9 or 18 holes each with a teeing ground that is set off by two markers showing the bounds of the legal tee area fairway rough and other hazards and the putting green surrounded by the fringe with the pin normally a flagstick and cup The levels of grass are varied to increase difficulty or to allow for putting in the case of the green While many holes are designed with a direct line of sight from the teeing area to the green some holes may bend either to the left or to the right This is commonly called a dogleg in reference to a dog s knee The hole is called a dogleg left if the hole angles leftwards and dogleg right if it bends right Sometimes a hole s direction may bend twice this is called a double dogleg A regular golf course consists of 18 holes but nine hole courses are common and can be played twice through for a full round of 18 holes 17 18 Early Scottish golf courses were primarily laid out on links land soil covered sand dunes directly inland from beaches 19 This gave rise to the term golf links particularly applied to seaside courses and those built on naturally sandy soil inland 20 The first 18 hole golf course in the United States was on a sheep farm in Downers Grove Illinois in 1892 The course is still there today 21 Every round of golf is based on playing a number of holes in a given order A round typically consists of 18 holes that are played in the order determined by the course layout Each hole is played once in the round on a standard course of 18 holes The game can be played by any number of people although a typical group playing will have 1 4 people playing the round The typical amount of time required for pace of play for a 9 hole round is two hours and four hours for an 18 hole round Playing a hole on a golf course is initiated by putting a ball into play by striking it with a club on the teeing ground also called the tee box or simply the tee For this first shot on each hole it is allowed but not required for the golfer to place the ball on a tee prior to striking it A tee is a small peg that can be used to elevate the ball slightly above the ground up to a few centimetres high Tees are commonly made of wood but may be constructed of any material including plastic Traditionally golfers used mounds of sand to elevate the ball and containers of sand were provided for the purpose A few courses still require sand to be used instead of peg tees to reduce litter and reduce damage to the teeing ground Tees help reduce the interference of the ground or grass on the movement of the club making the ball easier to hit and also places the ball in the very centre of the striking face of the club the sweet spot for better distance When the initial shot on a hole is intended to move the ball a long distance typically more than 225 yards 210 m the shot is commonly called a drive and is generally made with a long shafted large headed wood club called a driver Shorter holes may be initiated with other clubs such as higher numbered woods or irons Once the ball comes to rest the golfer strikes it again as many times as necessary using shots that are variously known as a lay up an approach a pitch or a chip until the ball reaches the green where he or she then putts the ball into the hole commonly called sinking the putt or holing out The goal of getting the ball into the hole holing the ball in as few strokes as possible may be impeded by obstacles such as areas of longer grass called rough usually found alongside fairways which both slows any ball that contacts it and makes it harder to advance a ball that has stopped on it doglegs which are changes in the direction of the fairway that often require shorter shots to play around them bunkers or sand traps and water hazards such as ponds or streams 17 In stroke play competitions played according to strict rules each player plays his or her ball until it is holed no matter how many strokes that may take In match play it is acceptable to simply pick up one s ball and surrender the hole after enough strokes have been made by a player that it is mathematically impossible for the player to win the hole It is also acceptable in informal stroke play to surrender the hole after hitting three strokes more than the par rating of the hole a triple bogey see below while technically a violation of Rule 3–2 this practice speeds play as a courtesy to others and avoids runaway scores excessive frustration and injuries caused by overexertion The total distance from the first teeing ground to the 18th green can be quite long total yardages through the green can be in excess of 7 000 yards 6 4 km and when adding in the travel distance between the green of one hole and the tee of the next even skilled players may easily travel five miles 8 km or more during a round At some courses electric golf carts are used to travel between shots which can speed up play and allows participation by individuals unable to walk a whole round On other courses players generally walk the course either carrying their bag using a shoulder strap or using a golf trolley for their bag These trolleys may or may not be battery assisted At many amateur tournaments including U S high school and college play players are required to walk and to carry their own bags but at the professional and top amateur level as well as at high level private clubs players may be accompanied by caddies who carry and manage the players equipment and who are allowed by the rules to give advice on the play of the course 22 A caddie s advice can only be given to the player or players for whom the caddie is working and not to other competing players The rules of golf are internationally standardised and are jointly governed by The R A spun off in 2004 from The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews founded 1754 and the United States Golf Association USGA 23 24 With the aim of simplifying the rules in 2017 the USGA and R A undertook a complete rewrite 25 The new rule book came into effect in January 2019 26 The underlying principle of the rules is fairness As stated on the back cover of the official rule book There are strict regulations regarding the amateur status of golfers 27 Essentially anybody who has ever received payment or compensation for giving instruction or played golf for money is not considered an amateur and may not participate in competitions limited solely to amateurs However amateur golfers may receive expenses that comply with strict guidelines and they may accept non cash prizes within the limits established by the Rules of Amateur Status In addition to the officially printed rules golfers also abide by a set of guidelines called golf etiquette Etiquette guidelines cover matters such as safety fairness pace of play and a player s obligation to contribute to the care of the course Though there are no penalties for breach of etiquette rules players generally follow the rules of golf etiquette in an effort to improve everyone s playing experience Penalty strokes are incurred in certain situations and are counted towards a player s score as if there were extra swing s at the ball Either one or two strokes are added for most rule infractions or for taking relief from various situations with the general penalty defined as two strokes and disqualification for severe or repeated rule breaches Examples include Golf clubs are used to hit the golf ball Each club is composed of a shaft with a lance or grip on the top end and a club head on the bottom Long clubs which have a lower amount of degree loft are those meant to propel the ball a comparatively longer distance and short clubs a higher degree of loft and a comparatively shorter distance The actual physical length of each club is longer or shorter depending on the distance the club is intended to propel the ball Golf clubs have traditionally been arranged into three basic types Woods are large headed long shafted clubs meant to propel the ball a long distance from relatively open lies such as the teeing ground and fairway Of particular importance is the driver or 1 wood which is the lowest lofted wood club and in modern times has become highly specialized for making extremely long distance tee shots up to 300 yards 270 m or more in a professional golfer s hands Traditionally these clubs had heads made of a hardwood hence the name but virtually all modern woods are now made of metal such as titanium or of composite materials Irons are shorter shafted clubs with a metal head primarily consisting of a flat angled striking face Traditionally the clubhead was forged from iron modern iron clubheads are investment cast from a steel alloy Irons of varying loft are used for a variety of shots from virtually anywhere on the course but most often for shorter distance shots approaching the green or to get the ball out of tricky lies such as sand traps The third class is the putter which evolved from the irons to create a low lofted balanced club designed to roll the ball along the green and into the hole Putters are virtually always used on the green or in the surrounding rough fringe A fourth class called hybrids evolved as a cross between woods and irons and are typically seen replacing the low lofted irons with a club that provides similar distance but a higher launch angle and a more forgiving nature A maximum of 14 clubs is allowed in a player s bag at one time during a stipulated round The choice of clubs is at the golfer s discretion although every club must be constructed in accordance with parameters outlined in the rules Clubs that meet these parameters are usually called conforming Violation of these rules can result in disqualification The exact shot hit at any given time on a golf course and which club is used to accomplish the shot are always completely at the discretion of the golfer in other words there is no restriction whatsoever on which club a golfer may or may not use at any time for any shot Golf balls are spherical usually white although other colours are allowed and minutely pock marked by dimples that decrease aerodynamic drag by increasing air turbulence around the ball in motion which delays boundary layer separation and reduces the drag inducing wake behind the ball thereby allowing the ball to fly farther 29 The combination of a soft boundary layer and a hard core enables both distance and spin A tee is allowed only for the first stroke on each hole unless the player must hit a provisional tee shot or replay his or her first shot from the tee Many golfers wear golf shoes with metal or plastic spikes designed to increase traction thus allowing for longer and more accurate shots A golf bag is used to transport golf clubs and the player s other or personal equipment Golf bags have several pockets designed for carrying equipment and supplies such as tees balls and gloves Golf bags can be carried pulled on a trolley or harnessed to a motorized golf cart during play Golf bags usually have both a hand strap and shoulder strap for carrying others may be carried over both shoulders like a backpack and often bags have retractable legs that allow the bag to stand upright when at rest The golf swing is outwardly similar to many other motions involving swinging a tool or playing implement such as an axe or a baseball bat However unlike many of these motions the result of the swing is highly dependent on several sub motions being properly aligned and timed These ensure that the club travels up to the ball in line with the desired path that the clubface is in line with the swing path and that the ball hits the centre or sweet spot of the clubface The ability to do this consistently across a complete set of clubs with a wide range of shaft lengths and clubface areas is a key skill for any golfer and takes a significant effort to achieve Stance refers to how the golfer positions themselves in order to play a stroke it is fundamentally important in being able to play a stroke effectively The stance adopted is determined by what stroke is being played All stances involve a slight crouch This allows for a more efficient striking posture whilst also isometrically preloading the muscles of the legs and core this allows the stroke to be played more dynamically and with a greater level of overall control When adopting their stance golfers start with the non dominant side of the body facing the target for a right hander the target is to their left Setting the stance in regard to the position of the ball and placing the clubhead behind the ball is known as being at address when in this position the player s body and the centerline of the club face are positioned parallel to the desired line of travel with the feet either perpendicular to that line or slightly splayed outward The feet are commonly shoulder width apart for middle irons and putters narrower for short irons and wider for long irons and woods The ball is typically positioned more to the front of the player s stance closer to the leading foot for lower lofted clubs with the usual ball position for a drive being just behind the arch of the leading foot The ball is placed further back in the player s stance toward the trailing foot as the loft of the club to be used increases Most iron shots and putts are made with the ball roughly centered in the stance while a few mid and short iron shots are made with the ball slightly behind the centre of the stance to ensure consistent contact between the ball and clubface so the ball is on its way before the club continues down into the turf The golfer chooses a golf club grip and stroke appropriate to the distance Having chosen a club and stroke to produce the desired distance the player addresses the ball by taking their stance to the side of it and except when the ball lies in a hazard grounding the club behind the ball The golfer then takes their backswing rotating the club their arms and their upper body away from the ball and then begins their swing bringing the clubhead back down and around to hit the ball A proper golf swing is a complex combination of motions and slight variations in posture or positioning can make a great deal of difference in how well the ball is hit and how straight it travels The general goal of a player making a full swing is to propel the clubhead as fast as possible while maintaining a single plane of motion of the club and clubhead to send the clubhead into the ball along the desired path of travel and with the clubhead also pointing that direction Accuracy and consistency are typically stressed over pure distance A player with a straight drive that travels only 220 yards 200 m will nevertheless be able to accurately place the ball into a favourable lie on the fairway and can make up for the lesser distance of any given club by simply using more club a lower loft on their tee shot or on subsequent fairway and approach shots However a golfer with a drive that may go 280 yards 260 m but often does not fly straight will be less able to position their ball advantageously the ball may hook pull draw fade push or slice off the intended line and land out of bounds or in the rough or hazards and thus the player will require many more strokes to hole out A golf stroke uses the muscles of the core especially erector spinae muscles and latissimus dorsi muscle when turning hamstring shoulder and wrist Stronger muscles in the wrist can prevent them from being twisted during swings whilst stronger shoulders increase the turning force Weak wrists can also transmit the force to elbows and even neck and lead to injury When a muscle contracts it pulls equally from both ends and to have movement at only one end of the muscle other muscles must come into play to stabilize the bone to which the other end of the muscle is attached Golf is a unilateral exercise that can break body balances requiring exercises to keep the balance in muscles 30 31 Putting is considered to be the most important component of the game of golf As the game of golf has evolved there have been many different putting techniques and grips that have been devised to give golfers the best chance to make putts When the game originated golfers would putt with their dominant hand on the bottom of the grip and their weak hand on top of the grip This grip and putting style is known as conventional There are many variations of conventional including overlap where the golfer overlaps the off hand index finger onto off the dominant pinky interlock where the offhand index finger interlocks with the dominant pinky and ring finger double or triple overlap and so on 32 Recently cross handed putting has become a popular trend amongst professional golfers and amateurs Cross handed putting is the idea that the dominant hand is on top of the grip where the weak hand is on the bottom This grip restricts the motion in your dominant hand and eliminates the possibility of wrist breakdowns through the putting stroke 33 Other notable putting styles include the claw a style that has the grip directly in between the thumb and index finger of the dominant hand while the palm faces the target 34 The weak hand placed normally on the putter Anchored putting a style that requires a longer putter shaft that can be anchored into the player s stomach or below the chin the idea is to stabilize one end of the putter thus creating a more consistent pendulum stroke This style has been banned on professional circuits since 2016 35 A hole is classified by its par which gives an indication of the number of strokes a skilled golfer may be expected to need to complete play of the hole 17 The primary factor for classifying the par of a relatively straight hazard free hole is the distance from the tee to the green and calculates the number of strokes a skilled golfer is expected to require to reach the green with an additional allowance of 2 putts As such the minimum par of any hole is 3 one stroke for the tee shot and two putts Par 3 4 and 5 holes are commonplace on golf courses far more rarely courses may feature par 6 and even par 7 holes For men a typical par 3 hole is less than 250 yards 230 m in length with a par 4 hole ranging between 251–450 yards 230–411 m and a par 5 hole being longer than 450 yards 410 m for women these boundaries are lower and for professionals they are much increased The rare par 6s can stretch well over 650 yards 590 m These distances are based on the typical scratch golfer s drive distance of between 240 and 280 yards 220 and 260 m Although length is the primary factor in calculating par other factors are taken into account however the number of strokes a scratch golfer should take to make the green remains foremost Factors affecting the calculation include altitude gradient of the land from the tee to green and forced lay ups due to dog legs sharp bends or obstacles e g bunkers water hazards 36 Getting the ball onto the green in two strokes less than par and hence meeting the par calculation criteria is called making green in regulation or GIR 37 Missing a GIR does not necessarily mean a golfer will not make par but it does make doing so more difficult as it reduces the number of putts available conversely making a GIR does not guarantee a par as the player might require three or more putts to hole out Professional golfers typically make between 60% and 70% of greens in regulation 38 Eighteen hole courses typically total to an overall par score of 70 to 72 for a complete round with most holes having a par of 4 and a smaller number of par 3 and par 5 holes Additionally courses may be classified according to their play difficulty which may be used to calculate a golfer s handicap 39 The two primary difficulty ratings in the U S are the Course Rating which is the expected score for a zero handicap scratch golfer and the Slope Rating which is a measure of how much worse a bogey golfer handicap around 20 would be expected to play than a scratch golfer relative to their handicap The goal is to play as few strokes per round as possible A golfer s number of strokes in a hole course or tournament is compared to its respective par score and is then reported either as the number that the golfer was under or over par or if it was equal to par A hole in one or an ace occurs when a golfer sinks their ball into the cup with their first stroke from the tee Common scores for a hole also have specific terms 17 In a typical professional tournament or among scratch amateur players birdie bogey play is common a player will lose a stroke by bogeying a hole then gain one by scoring a birdie Eagles are uncommon but not rare however only 18 players have scored an albatross in a men s major championship One of the rarest feats in golf is the condor which has never occurred in a professional tournament Only five condors have been verified to have ever occurred although none of the courses involved were professionally accredited 40 There are two basic forms of golf play match play and stroke play Stroke play is more popular Two players or two teams play each hole as a separate contest against each other in what is called match play The party with the lower score wins that hole or if the scores of both players or teams are equal the hole is halved or tied The game is won by the party that wins more holes than the other In the case that one team or player has taken a lead that cannot be overcome in the number of holes remaining to be played the match is deemed to be won by the party in the lead and the remainder of the holes are not played For example if one party already has a lead of six holes and only five holes remain to be played on the course the match is over and the winning party is deemed to have won 6 5 At any given point if the lead is equal to the number of holes remaining the party leading the match is said to be dormie and the match is continued until the party increases the lead by one hole or ties any of the remaining holes thereby winning the match or until the match ends in a tie with the lead player s opponent winning all remaining holes When the game is tied after the predetermined number of holes have been played it may be continued until one side takes a one hole lead 17 The score achieved for each and every hole of the round or tournament is added to produce the total score and the player with the lowest score wins in stroke play Stroke play is the game most commonly played by professional golfers If there is a tie after the regulation number of holes in a professional tournament a playoff takes place between all tied players Playoffs either are sudden death or employ a pre determined number of holes anywhere from three to a full 18 In sudden death a player who scores lower on a hole than all of his opponents wins the match If at least two players remain tied after such a playoff using a pre determined number of holes then play continues in sudden death format where the first player to win a hole wins the tournament There are many variations in scoring and playing formats in the game of golf some officially defined in the Rules of Golf Variations include the popular Stableford scoring system and various team formats Some common and popular examples are listed below There are also variations on the usual starting procedure where everyone begins from the first tee and plays all holes in order though to the eighteenth In large field tournaments especially on professional tours a two tee start is commonplace where the field will be split between starting on the first tee and the tenth tee sometimes the eighth or eleventh depending on proximity to the clubhouse Shotgun starts are mainly used for amateur tournament or society play In this variant each of the groups playing starts their game on a different hole allowing for all players to start and end their round at roughly the same time For example a group starting on hole 5 will play through to the 18th hole and continue with hole 1 ending their round on hole 4 A bogey or par competition is a scoring format sometimes seen in informal tournaments Its scoring is similar to match play except each player compares their hole score to the hole s par rating instead of the score of another player The player wins the hole if they score a birdie or better they lose the hole if they score a bogey or worse and they halve the hole by scoring par By recording only this simple win loss halve score on the sheet a player can shrug off a very poorly played hole with a simple mark and move on As used in competitions the player or pair with the best win loss differential wins the competition The Stableford system is a simplification of stroke play that awards players points based on their score relative to the hole s par the score for a hole is calculated by taking the par score adding 2 then subtracting the player s hole score making the result zero if negative Alternately stated a double bogey or worse is zero points a bogey is worth one point par is two a birdie three an eagle four and so on The advantages of this system over stroke play are a more natural higher is better scoring the ability to compare Stableford scores between plays on courses with different total par scores scoring an even in stroke play will always give a Stableford score of 36 discouraging the tendency to abandon the entire game after playing a particularly bad hole a novice playing by strict rules may score as high as an 8 or 10 on a single difficult hole their Stableford score for the hole would be zero which puts them only two points behind par no matter how badly they played and the ability to simply pick up one s ball once it is impossible to score any points for the hole which speeds play The USGA and R A sanction a Modified Stableford system for scratch players which makes par worth zero a birdie worth 2 eagle 5 and double eagle 8 while a bogey is a penalty of −1 and a double bogey or worse −3 As with the original system the highest score wins the game and terrible scores on one or two holes will not ruin a player s overall score but this system rewards bogey birdie play more than the original encouraging golfers to try to make riskier birdie putt or eagle chipshots instead of simply parring each hole 17 A handicap is a numerical measure of a golfer s potential scoring ability over 18 holes It is used to enable players of widely varying abilities to compete against one another Better players are those with the lowest handicaps and someone with a handicap of 0 or less is often referred to as a scratch golfer Handicap systems vary throughout the world and use different methods to assess courses and calculate handicaps In order to address difficulties in translating between these systems the USGA and The R A working with the various existing handicapping authorities devised a new World Handicap System which is set to be introduced globally starting in 2020 46 Golf courses are assessed and rated according to the average good score of a scratch golfer taking into account a multitude of factors affecting play such as length obstacles undulations etc A player s handicap gives an indication of the number of strokes above this course rating that the player will make over the course of an average best round of golf i e scoring near their potential above average 47 Lower handicap players are generally the most consistent so can be expected to play to this standard or better more often than higher handicappers Some handicap systems also account for differences in scoring difficulty between low and high handicap golfer They do this by means of assessing and rating courses according to the average good score of a bogey golfer a player with a handicap of around 20 This is used with the course rating to calculate a slope rating which is used to adjust golfer s handicap to produce a playing handicap for the course and set of tees being used 48 Handicap systems have potential for abuse by players who may intentionally play badly to increase their handicap sandbagging before playing to their potential at an important event with a valuable prize For this reason handicaps are not used in professional golf but they can still be calculated and used along with other criteria to determine the relative strengths of various professional players Touring professionals being the best of the best have negative handicaps they can be expected more often than not to score lower than the Course Rating on any course In 2005 Golf Digest calculated that the countries with most golf courses per capita in order were Scotland New Zealand Australia Ireland Canada Wales United States Sweden and England countries with fewer than 500 000 people were excluded The number of courses in other territories has increased an example of this being the expansion of golf in China The first golf course in China opened in 1984 but by the end of 2009 there were roughly 600 in the country For much of the 21st century development of new golf courses in China has been officially banned with the exception of the island province of Hainan but the number of courses had nonetheless tripled from 2004 to 2009 the ban has been evaded with the government s tacit approval simply by not mentioning golf in any development plans 49 In the United States the number of people who play golf twenty five times or more per year decreased from 6 9 million in 2000 to 4 6 million in 2005 50 according to the National Golf Foundation The NGF reported that the number who played golf at all decreased from 30 to 26 million over the same period 50 In February 1971 astronaut Alan Shepard became the first person to golf anywhere other than Earth He smuggled a golf club and two golf balls on board Apollo 14 with the intent to golf on the Moon He attempted two drives He shanked the first attempt but it is estimated his second went more than 200 yards 180 m 51 Number of golf courses by country in 2015 Below are the top 18 countries that have the most golf courses 52 The majority of professional golfers work as club or teaching professionals pros and only compete in local competitions A small elite of professional golfers are tournament pros who compete full time on international tours Many club and teaching professionals working in the golf industry start as caddies or with a general interest in the game finding employment at golf courses and eventually moving on to certifications in their chosen profession These programs include independent institutions and universities and those that eventually lead to a Class A golf professional certification Touring professionals typically start as amateur players who attain their pro status after success in major tournaments that win them either prize money and or notice from corporate sponsors Jack Nicklaus for example gained widespread notice by finishing second in the 1960 U S Open to champion Arnold Palmer with a 72 hole score of 282 the best score to date in that tournament by an amateur He played one more amateur year in 1961 winning that year s U S Amateur Championship before turning pro in 1962 Golf instruction involves the teaching and learning of the game of golf Proficiency in teaching golf instruction requires not only technical and physical ability but also knowledge of the rules and etiquette of the game In some countries golf instruction is best performed by teachers certified by the Professional Golfers Association Some top instructors who work with professional golfers have become quite well known in their own right Professional golf instructors can use physical conditioning mental visualization classroom sessions club fitting driving range instruction on course play under real conditions and review of videotaped swings in slow motion to teach golf to prepare the golfer for the course There are at least twenty professional golf tours each run by a PGA or an independent tour organization which is responsible for arranging events finding sponsors and regulating the tour Typically a tour has members who are entitled to compete in most of its events and also invites non members to compete in some of them Gaining membership of an elite tour is highly competitive and most professional golfers never achieve it Perhaps the most widely known tour is the PGA Tour which tends to attract the strongest fields outside the four Majors and the four World Golf Championships events This is due mostly to the fact that most PGA Tour events have a first prize of at least 800 000 USD The European Tour which attracts a substantial number of top golfers from outside North America ranks second to the PGA Tour in worldwide prestige Some top professionals from outside North America play enough tournaments to maintain membership on both the PGA Tour and European Tour Since 2010 both tours money titles have been claimed by the same individual three times with Luke Donald doing so in 2011 and Rory McIlroy in 2012 and 2014 In 2013 Henrik Stenson won the FedEx Cup points race on the PGA Tour and the European Tour money title but did not top the PGA Tour money list that honour going to Tiger Woods The other leading men s tours include the Japan Golf Tour the Asian Tour Asia outside Japan the PGA Tour of Australasia and the Sunshine Tour for southern Africa primarily South Africa The Japan Australasian Sunshine PGA and European Tours are the charter members of the trade body of the world s main tours the International Federation of PGA Tours founded in 1996 The Asian Tour became a full member in 1999 The Canadian Tour became an associate member of the Federation in 2000 and the Tour de las Américas Latin America became an associate member of the Federation in 2007 The Federation underwent a major expansion in 2009 that saw eleven new tours become full members – the Canadian Tour Tour de las Américas China Golf Association the Korea Professional Golfers Association Professional Golf Tour of India and the operators of all six major women s tours worldwide The OneAsia Tour founded in 2009 is not a member of the Federation but was founded as a joint venture of the Australasia China Japan and Korean tours In 2011 the Tour de las Américas was effectively taken over by the PGA Tour and in 2012 was folded into the new PGA Tour Latinoamérica Also in 2012 the Canadian Tour was renamed PGA Tour Canada after it agreed to be taken over by the PGA Tour All men s tours that are Federation members except the India tour offer points in the Official World Golf Ranking OWGR to players who place sufficiently high in their events The OneAsia Tour also offers ranking points Golf is unique in having lucrative competition for older players There are several senior tours for men aged fifty and over arguably the best known of which is the U S based PGA Tour Champions There are six principal tours for women each based in a different country or continent The most prestigious of these is the United States based LPGA Tour All of the principal tours offer points in the Women s World Golf Rankings for high finishers in their events All of the leading professional tours for under 50 players have an official developmental tour in which the leading players at the end of the season will earn a tour card on the main tour for the following season Examples include the Web com Tour which feeds to the PGA Tour and the Challenge Tour which is the developmental tour of the European Tour The Web com and Challenge Tours also offer OWGR points The major championships are the four most prestigious men s tournaments of the year In chronological order they are The Masters the U S Open The Open Championship referred to in North America as the British Open and the PGA Championship 53 The fields for these events include the top several dozen golfers from all over the world The Masters has been played at Augusta National Golf Club in Augusta Georgia since its inception in 1934 It is the only major championship that is played at the same course each year 54 The U S Open and PGA Championship are played at courses around the United States while the Open Championship is played at courses around the United Kingdom 55 Prior to the advent of the PGA Championship and The Masters the four Majors were the U S Open the U S Amateur the Open Championship and the British Amateur Women s golf does not have a globally agreed set of majors The list of majors recognised by the dominant women s tour the LPGA Tour in the U S has changed several times over the years with the most recent changes occurring in 2001 and 2013 Like the PGA Tour the U S LPGA 56 tour long had four majors but now has five the ANA Inspiration previously known by several other names most recently the Kraft Nabisco Championship the Women s PGA Championship previously known as the LPGA Championship 57 the U S Women s Open the Women s British Open which replaced the du Maurier Classic as a major in 2001 and The Evian Championship added as the fifth major in 2013 Only the last two are also recognised as majors by the Ladies European Tour However the significance of this is limited as the LPGA is far more dominant in women s golf than the PGA Tour is in mainstream men s golf For example the BBC has been known to use the U S definition of women s majors without qualifying it Also the Ladies Golf Union the governing body for women s golf in Great Britain and Ireland stated on its official website that the Women s British Open was the only Women s Major to be played outside the U S 58 this was before the elevation of The Evian Championship to major status For many years the Ladies European Tour tacitly acknowledged the dominance of the LPGA Tour by not scheduling any of its own events to conflict with the three LPGA majors played in the U S but that changed beginning in 2008 when the LET scheduled an event opposite the LPGA Championship The second richest women s tour the LPGA of Japan Tour does not recognise any of the U S LPGA or European majors as it has its own set of majors historically three since 2008 four However these events attract little notice outside Japan Senior aged fifty and over men s golf does not have a globally agreed set of majors The list of senior majors on the U S based PGA Tour Champions has changed over the years but always by expansion PGA Tour Champions now recognises five majors the Senior PGA Championship The Tradition the Senior Players Championship the United States Senior Open and The Senior British Open Championship Of the five events the Senior PGA is by far the oldest having been founded in 1937 The other events all date from the 1980s when senior golf became a commercial success as the first golf stars of the television era such as Arnold Palmer and Gary Player reached the relevant age The Senior Open Championship was not recognised as a major by PGA Tour Champions until 2003 The European Senior Tour recognises only the Senior PGA and the two Senior Opens as majors However PGA Tour Champions is arguably more dominant in global senior golf than the U S LPGA is in global women s golf After a 112 year absence from the Olympic Games golf returned for the 2016 Rio Games 59 41 different countries were represented by 120 athletes 60 It was not until 1552 that the first woman golfer played the game Mary Queen of Scots commissioned St Andrew s Links 61 However it was not until the 20th century that women were taken seriously and eventually broke the Gentlemen Only Ladies Forbidden rule Many men saw women as unfit to play the sport due to their supposed lack of strength and ability In 1891 the newly built Shinnecock Hills nine hole course in Southampton New York became the first club to offer membership to women golfers Four years later in 1895 The U S Golf Association held the first Women s Amateur Championship tournament 61 62 Just like professional golfer Bobby Jones Joyce Wethered was considered to be a star in the 1920s 63 Jones praised Wethered in 1930 after they had played an exhibition against each other He doubted that there had ever been a better golfer man or woman 64 However Bobby Jones comment was not enough for others to change their views on women golfers The Royal Liverpool s club refused entry of Sir Henry Cotton s wife into the clubhouse in the late 1940s The secretary of the club released a statement saying No woman ever has entered the clubhouse and praise God no woman ever will 63 However American golfer and all around athlete Babe Zaharias did not have to enter the clubhouse She was able to prove herself on the course going on to become the first American to win the British Women s Amateur title in 1947 The following year she became the first woman to attempt to qualify for the U S Open but her application was rejected by the USGA They stated that the event was intended to be open to men only 65 The Ladies Professional Golf Association was formed in 1950 as a way to popularize the sport and provide competitive opportunities for golfers 63 The competitions were not the same for the men and women It was not until 1972 that U S Congress passed the Title IX of the Education Amendments No person in the United States shall on the basis of sex be excluded from participation in be denied the benefits of or be subject to discrimination under any education program or activities receiving Federal financial assistance 66 American Renee Powell moved to the UK in the 1970s to further her career and became the first woman to play in a British men s tournament in 1977 67 Today women golfers are still fighting to have the same opportunities as men golfers There is still a big pay gap in the USGA The USGA has a long history of writing bigger checks to winners of the men s U S Open than the U S Women s Open 68 Golf Contents Origin and history Golf course Play of the game Rules and regulations Equipment Stroke mechanics Scoring and handicapping Popularity

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf,Golf,,,Golf is a club and ball sport in which players use various clubs to hit balls into a series of holes on a course in as few strokes as possible Golf unlike most ball games cannot and does not utilize a standardized playing area and coping with the varied terrains encountered on different courses is a key part of the game The game at the usual level is played on a course with an arranged progression of 18 holes though recreational courses can be smaller often having nine holes Each hole on the course must contain a teeing ground to start from and a putting green containing the actual hole or cup mw parser output frac{white space nowrap} mw parser output frac num mw parser output frac den{font size 80% line height 0 vertical align super} mw

diameter There are other standard forms of terrain in between such as the fairway rough long grass bunkers or sand traps and various hazards water rocks but each hole on a course is unique in its specific layout and arrangement Golf is played for the lowest number of strokes by an individual known as stroke play or the lowest score on the most individual holes in a complete round by an individual or team known as match play Stroke play is the most commonly seen format at all levels but most especially at the elite level The modern game of golf originated in 15th century Scotland The 18 hole round was created at the Old Course at St Andrews in 1764 Golf s first major and the world s oldest tournament in existence is The Open Championship also known as the British Open which was first played in 1860 at the Prestwick Golf Club in Ayrshire Scotland This is one of the four major championships in men s professional golf the other three being played in the United States The Masters the U S Open and the PGA Championship While the modern game of golf originated in 15th century Scotland the game s ancient origins are unclear and much debated Some historians 3 trace the sport back to the Roman game of paganica in which participants used a bent stick to hit a stuffed leather ball One theory asserts that paganica spread throughout Europe as the Romans conquered most of the continent during the first century BC and eventually evolved into the modern game 4 Others cite chuiwan 捶丸 chui means striking and wan means small ball 5 as the progenitor a Chinese game played between the eighth and fourteenth centuries 6 A Ming Dynasty scroll by the artist Youqiu dating back to 1368 entitled The Autumn Banquet shows a member of the Chinese Imperial court swinging what appears to be a golf club at a small ball with the aim of sinking it into a hole 5 The game is thought to have been introduced into Europe during the Middle Ages 7 Another early game that resembled modern golf was known as cambuca in England and chambot in France 7 The Persian game chowkan is another possible ancient origin albeit being more polo like In addition kolven a game involving a ball and curved bats was played annually in Loenen Netherlands beginning in 1297 to commemorate the capture of the assassin of Floris V a year earlier The modern game originated in Scotland where the first written record of golf is James II s banning of the game in 1457 as an unwelcome distraction to learning archery 8 James IV lifted the ban in 1502 when he became a golfer himself with golf clubs first recorded in 1503–1504 For golf clubbes and balles to the King that he playit with 9 To many golfers the Old Course at St Andrews a links course dating to before 1574 is considered to be a site of pilgrimage 10 In 1764 the standard 18 hole golf course was created at St Andrews when members modified the course from 22 to 18 holes 11 Golf is documented as being played on Musselburgh Links East Lothian Scotland as early as 2 March 1672 which is certified as the oldest golf course in the world by Guinness World Records 12 13 The oldest surviving rules of golf were compiled in March 1744 for the Company of Gentlemen Golfers later renamed The Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers which was played at Leith Scotland 14 The world s oldest golf tournament in existence and golf s first major is The Open Championship which was first played on 17 October 1860 at Prestwick Golf Club in Ayrshire Scotland with Scottish golfers winning the earliest majors 15 Two Scotsmen from Dunfermline John Reid and Robert Lockhart first demonstrated golf in the U S by setting up a hole in an orchard in 1888 with Reid setting up America s first golf club the same year Saint Andrew s Golf Club in Yonkers New York 16 A golf course consists of either 9 or 18 holes each with a teeing ground that is set off by two markers showing the bounds of the legal tee area fairway rough and other hazards and the putting green surrounded by the fringe with the pin normally a flagstick and cup The levels of grass are varied to increase difficulty or to allow for putting in the case of the green While many holes are designed with a direct line of sight from the teeing area to the green some holes may bend either to the left or to the right This is commonly called a dogleg in reference to a dog s knee The hole is called a dogleg left if the hole angles leftwards and dogleg right if it bends right Sometimes a hole s direction may bend twice this is called a double dogleg A regular golf course consists of 18 holes but nine hole courses are common and can be played twice through for a full round of 18 holes 17 18 Early Scottish golf courses were primarily laid out on links land soil covered sand dunes directly inland from beaches 19 This gave rise to the term golf links particularly applied to seaside courses and those built on naturally sandy soil inland 20 The first 18 hole golf course in the United States was on a sheep farm in Downers Grove Illinois in 1892 The course is still there today 21 Every round of golf is based on playing a number of holes in a given order A round typically consists of 18 holes that are played in the order determined by the course layout Each hole is played once in the round on a standard course of 18 holes The game can be played by any number of people although a typical group playing will have 1 4 people playing the round The typical amount of time required for pace of play for a 9 hole round is two hours and four hours for an 18 hole round Playing a hole on a golf course is initiated by putting a ball into play by striking it with a club on the teeing ground also called the tee box or simply the tee For this first shot on each hole it is allowed but not required for the golfer to place the ball on a tee prior to striking it A tee is a small peg that can be used to elevate the ball slightly above the ground up to a few centimetres high Tees are commonly made of wood but may be constructed of any material including plastic Traditionally golfers used mounds of sand to elevate the ball and containers of sand were provided for the purpose A few courses still require sand to be used instead of peg tees to reduce litter and reduce damage to the teeing ground Tees help reduce the interference of the ground or grass on the movement of the club making the ball easier to hit and also places the ball in the very centre of the striking face of the club the sweet spot for better distance When the initial shot on a hole is intended to move the ball a long distance typically more than 225 yards 210 m the shot is commonly called a drive and is generally made with a long shafted large headed wood club called a driver Shorter holes may be initiated with other clubs such as higher numbered woods or irons Once the ball comes to rest the golfer strikes it again as many times as necessary using shots that are variously known as a lay up an approach a pitch or a chip until the ball reaches the green where he or she then putts the ball into the hole commonly called sinking the putt or holing out The goal of getting the ball into the hole holing the ball in as few strokes as possible may be impeded by obstacles such as areas of longer grass called rough usually found alongside fairways which both slows any ball that contacts it and makes it harder to advance a ball that has stopped on it doglegs which are changes in the direction of the fairway that often require shorter shots to play around them bunkers or sand traps and water hazards such as ponds or streams 17 In stroke play competitions played according to strict rules each player plays his or her ball until it is holed no matter how many strokes that may take In match play it is acceptable to simply pick up one s ball and surrender the hole after enough strokes have been made by a player that it is mathematically impossible for the player to win the hole It is also acceptable in informal stroke play to surrender the hole after hitting three strokes more than the par rating of the hole a triple bogey see below while technically a violation of Rule 3–2 this practice speeds play as a courtesy to others and avoids runaway scores excessive frustration and injuries caused by overexertion The total distance from the first teeing ground to the 18th green can be quite long total yardages through the green can be in excess of 7 000 yards 6 4 km and when adding in the travel distance between the green of one hole and the tee of the next even skilled players may easily travel five miles 8 km or more during a round At some courses electric golf carts are used to travel between shots which can speed up play and allows participation by individuals unable to walk a whole round On other courses players generally walk the course either carrying their bag using a shoulder strap or using a golf trolley for their bag These trolleys may or may not be battery assisted At many amateur tournaments including U S high school and college play players are required to walk and to carry their own bags but at the professional and top amateur level as well as at high level private clubs players may be accompanied by caddies who carry and manage the players equipment and who are allowed by the rules to give advice on the play of the course 22 A caddie s advice can only be given to the player or players for whom the caddie is working and not to other competing players The rules of golf are internationally standardised and are jointly governed by The R A spun off in 2004 from The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews founded 1754 and the United States Golf Association USGA 23 24 With the aim of simplifying the rules in 2017 the USGA and R A undertook a complete rewrite 25 The new rule book came into effect in January 2019 26 The underlying principle of the rules is fairness As stated on the back cover of the official rule book There are strict regulations regarding the amateur status of golfers 27 Essentially anybody who has ever received payment or compensation for giving instruction or played golf for money is not considered an amateur and may not participate in competitions limited solely to amateurs However amateur golfers may receive expenses that comply with strict guidelines and they may accept non cash prizes within the limits established by the Rules of Amateur Status In addition to the officially printed rules golfers also abide by a set of guidelines called golf etiquette Etiquette guidelines cover matters such as safety fairness pace of play and a player s obligation to contribute to the care of the course Though there are no penalties for breach of etiquette rules players generally follow the rules of golf etiquette in an effort to improve everyone s playing experience Penalty strokes are incurred in certain situations and are counted towards a player s score as if there were extra swing s at the ball Either one or two strokes are added for most rule infractions or for taking relief from various situations with the general penalty defined as two strokes and disqualification for severe or repeated rule breaches Examples include Golf clubs are used to hit the golf ball Each club is composed of a shaft with a lance or grip on the top end and a club head on the bottom Long clubs which have a lower amount of degree loft are those meant to propel the ball a comparatively longer distance and short clubs a higher degree of loft and a comparatively shorter distance The actual physical length of each club is longer or shorter depending on the distance the club is intended to propel the ball Golf clubs have traditionally been arranged into three basic types Woods are large headed long shafted clubs meant to propel the ball a long distance from relatively open lies such as the teeing ground and fairway Of particular importance is the driver or 1 wood which is the lowest lofted wood club and in modern times has become highly specialized for making extremely long distance tee shots up to 300 yards 270 m or more in a professional golfer s hands Traditionally these clubs had heads made of a hardwood hence the name but virtually all modern woods are now made of metal such as titanium or of composite materials Irons are shorter shafted clubs with a metal head primarily consisting of a flat angled striking face Traditionally the clubhead was forged from iron modern iron clubheads are investment cast from a steel alloy Irons of varying loft are used for a variety of shots from virtually anywhere on the course but most often for shorter distance shots approaching the green or to get the ball out of tricky lies such as sand traps The third class is the putter which evolved from the irons to create a low lofted balanced club designed to roll the ball along the green and into the hole Putters are virtually always used on the green or in the surrounding rough fringe A fourth class called hybrids evolved as a cross between woods and irons and are typically seen replacing the low lofted irons with a club that provides similar distance but a higher launch angle and a more forgiving nature A maximum of 14 clubs is allowed in a player s bag at one time during a stipulated round The choice of clubs is at the golfer s discretion although every club must be constructed in accordance with parameters outlined in the rules Clubs that meet these parameters are usually called conforming Violation of these rules can result in disqualification The exact shot hit at any given time on a golf course and which club is used to accomplish the shot are always completely at the discretion of the golfer in other words there is no restriction whatsoever on which club a golfer may or may not use at any time for any shot Golf balls are spherical usually white although other colours are allowed and minutely pock marked by dimples that decrease aerodynamic drag by increasing air turbulence around the ball in motion which delays boundary layer separation and reduces the drag inducing wake behind the ball thereby allowing the ball to fly farther 29 The combination of a soft boundary layer and a hard core enables both distance and spin A tee is allowed only for the first stroke on each hole unless the player must hit a provisional tee shot or replay his or her first shot from the tee Many golfers wear golf shoes with metal or plastic spikes designed to increase traction thus allowing for longer and more accurate shots A golf bag is used to transport golf clubs and the player s other or personal equipment Golf bags have several pockets designed for carrying equipment and supplies such as tees balls and gloves Golf bags can be carried pulled on a trolley or harnessed to a motorized golf cart during play Golf bags usually have both a hand strap and shoulder strap for carrying others may be carried over both shoulders like a backpack and often bags have retractable legs that allow the bag to stand upright when at rest The golf swing is outwardly similar to many other motions involving swinging a tool or playing implement such as an axe or a baseball bat However unlike many of these motions the result of the swing is highly dependent on several sub motions being properly aligned and timed These ensure that the club travels up to the ball in line with the desired path that the clubface is in line with the swing path and that the ball hits the centre or sweet spot of the clubface The ability to do this consistently across a complete set of clubs with a wide range of shaft lengths and clubface areas is a key skill for any golfer and takes a significant effort to achieve Stance refers to how the golfer positions themselves in order to play a stroke it is fundamentally important in being able to play a stroke effectively The stance adopted is determined by what stroke is being played All stances involve a slight crouch This allows for a more efficient striking posture whilst also isometrically preloading the muscles of the legs and core this allows the stroke to be played more dynamically and with a greater level of overall control When adopting their stance golfers start with the non dominant side of the body facing the target for a right hander the target is to their left Setting the stance in regard to the position of the ball and placing the clubhead behind the ball is known as being at address when in this position the player s body and the centerline of the club face are positioned parallel to the desired line of travel with the feet either perpendicular to that line or slightly splayed outward The feet are commonly shoulder width apart for middle irons and putters narrower for short irons and wider for long irons and woods The ball is typically positioned more to the front of the player s stance closer to the leading foot for lower lofted clubs with the usual ball position for a drive being just behind the arch of the leading foot The ball is placed further back in the player s stance toward the trailing foot as the loft of the club to be used increases Most iron shots and putts are made with the ball roughly centered in the stance while a few mid and short iron shots are made with the ball slightly behind the centre of the stance to ensure consistent contact between the ball and clubface so the ball is on its way before the club continues down into the turf The golfer chooses a golf club grip and stroke appropriate to the distance Having chosen a club and stroke to produce the desired distance the player addresses the ball by taking their stance to the side of it and except when the ball lies in a hazard grounding the club behind the ball The golfer then takes their backswing rotating the club their arms and their upper body away from the ball and then begins their swing bringing the clubhead back down and around to hit the ball A proper golf swing is a complex combination of motions and slight variations in posture or positioning can make a great deal of difference in how well the ball is hit and how straight it travels The general goal of a player making a full swing is to propel the clubhead as fast as possible while maintaining a single plane of motion of the club and clubhead to send the clubhead into the ball along the desired path of travel and with the clubhead also pointing that direction Accuracy and consistency are typically stressed over pure distance A player with a straight drive that travels only 220 yards 200 m will nevertheless be able to accurately place the ball into a favourable lie on the fairway and can make up for the lesser distance of any given club by simply using more club a lower loft on their tee shot or on subsequent fairway and approach shots However a golfer with a drive that may go 280 yards 260 m but often does not fly straight will be less able to position their ball advantageously the ball may hook pull draw fade push or slice off the intended line and land out of bounds or in the rough or hazards and thus the player will require many more strokes to hole out A golf stroke uses the muscles of the core especially erector spinae muscles and latissimus dorsi muscle when turning hamstring shoulder and wrist Stronger muscles in the wrist can prevent them from being twisted during swings whilst stronger shoulders increase the turning force Weak wrists can also transmit the force to elbows and even neck and lead to injury When a muscle contracts it pulls equally from both ends and to have movement at only one end of the muscle other muscles must come into play to stabilize the bone to which the other end of the muscle is attached Golf is a unilateral exercise that can break body balances requiring exercises to keep the balance in muscles 30 31 Putting is considered to be the most important component of the game of golf As the game of golf has evolved there have been many different putting techniques and grips that have been devised to give golfers the best chance to make putts When the game originated golfers would putt with their dominant hand on the bottom of the grip and their weak hand on top of the grip This grip and putting style is known as conventional There are many variations of conventional including overlap where the golfer overlaps the off hand index finger onto off the dominant pinky interlock where the offhand index finger interlocks with the dominant pinky and ring finger double or triple overlap and so on 32 Recently cross handed putting has become a popular trend amongst professional golfers and amateurs Cross handed putting is the idea that the dominant hand is on top of the grip where the weak hand is on the bottom This grip restricts the motion in your dominant hand and eliminates the possibility of wrist breakdowns through the putting stroke 33 Other notable putting styles include the claw a style that has the grip directly in between the thumb and index finger of the dominant hand while the palm faces the target 34 The weak hand placed normally on the putter Anchored putting a style that requires a longer putter shaft that can be anchored into the player s stomach or below the chin the idea is to stabilize one end of the putter thus creating a more consistent pendulum stroke This style has been banned on professional circuits since 2016 35 A hole is classified by its par which gives an indication of the number of strokes a skilled golfer may be expected to need to complete play of the hole 17 The primary factor for classifying the par of a relatively straight hazard free hole is the distance from the tee to the green and calculates the number of strokes a skilled golfer is expected to require to reach the green with an additional allowance of 2 putts As such the minimum par of any hole is 3 one stroke for the tee shot and two putts Par 3 4 and 5 holes are commonplace on golf courses far more rarely courses may feature par 6 and even par 7 holes For men a typical par 3 hole is less than 250 yards 230 m in length with a par 4 hole ranging between 251–450 yards 230–411 m and a par 5 hole being longer than 450 yards 410 m for women these boundaries are lower and for professionals they are much increased The rare par 6s can stretch well over 650 yards 590 m These distances are based on the typical scratch golfer s drive distance of between 240 and 280 yards 220 and 260 m Although length is the primary factor in calculating par other factors are taken into account however the number of strokes a scratch golfer should take to make the green remains foremost Factors affecting the calculation include altitude gradient of the land from the tee to green and forced lay ups due to dog legs sharp bends or obstacles e g bunkers water hazards 36 Getting the ball onto the green in two strokes less than par and hence meeting the par calculation criteria is called making green in regulation or GIR 37 Missing a GIR does not necessarily mean a golfer will not make par but it does make doing so more difficult as it reduces the number of putts available conversely making a GIR does not guarantee a par as the player might require three or more putts to hole out Professional golfers typically make between 60% and 70% of greens in regulation 38 Eighteen hole courses typically total to an overall par score of 70 to 72 for a complete round with most holes having a par of 4 and a smaller number of par 3 and par 5 holes Additionally courses may be classified according to their play difficulty which may be used to calculate a golfer s handicap 39 The two primary difficulty ratings in the U S are the Course Rating which is the expected score for a zero handicap scratch golfer and the Slope Rating which is a measure of how much worse a bogey golfer handicap around 20 would be expected to play than a scratch golfer relative to their handicap The goal is to play as few strokes per round as possible A golfer s number of strokes in a hole course or tournament is compared to its respective par score and is then reported either as the number that the golfer was under or over par or if it was equal to par A hole in one or an ace occurs when a golfer sinks their ball into the cup with their first stroke from the tee Common scores for a hole also have specific terms 17 In a typical professional tournament or among scratch amateur players birdie bogey play is common a player will lose a stroke by bogeying a hole then gain one by scoring a birdie Eagles are uncommon but not rare however only 18 players have scored an albatross in a men s major championship One of the rarest feats in golf is the condor which has never occurred in a professional tournament Only five condors have been verified to have ever occurred although none of the courses involved were professionally accredited 40 There are two basic forms of golf play match play and stroke play Stroke play is more popular Two players or two teams play each hole as a separate contest against each other in what is called match play The party with the lower score wins that hole or if the scores of both players or teams are equal the hole is halved or tied The game is won by the party that wins more holes than the other In the case that one team or player has taken a lead that cannot be overcome in the number of holes remaining to be played the match is deemed to be won by the party in the lead and the remainder of the holes are not played For example if one party already has a lead of six holes and only five holes remain to be played on the course the match is over and the winning party is deemed to have won 6 5 At any given point if the lead is equal to the number of holes remaining the party leading the match is said to be dormie and the match is continued until the party increases the lead by one hole or ties any of the remaining holes thereby winning the match or until the match ends in a tie with the lead player s opponent winning all remaining holes When the game is tied after the predetermined number of holes have been played it may be continued until one side takes a one hole lead 17 The score achieved for each and every hole of the round or tournament is added to produce the total score and the player with the lowest score wins in stroke play Stroke play is the game most commonly played by professional golfers If there is a tie after the regulation number of holes in a professional tournament a playoff takes place between all tied players Playoffs either are sudden death or employ a pre determined number of holes anywhere from three to a full 18 In sudden death a player who scores lower on a hole than all of his opponents wins the match If at least two players remain tied after such a playoff using a pre determined number of holes then play continues in sudden death format where the first player to win a hole wins the tournament There are many variations in scoring and playing formats in the game of golf some officially defined in the Rules of Golf Variations include the popular Stableford scoring system and various team formats Some common and popular examples are listed below There are also variations on the usual starting procedure where everyone begins from the first tee and plays all holes in order though to the eighteenth In large field tournaments especially on professional tours a two tee start is commonplace where the field will be split between starting on the first tee and the tenth tee sometimes the eighth or eleventh depending on proximity to the clubhouse Shotgun starts are mainly used for amateur tournament or society play In this variant each of the groups playing starts their game on a different hole allowing for all players to start and end their round at roughly the same time For example a group starting on hole 5 will play through to the 18th hole and continue with hole 1 ending their round on hole 4 A bogey or par competition is a scoring format sometimes seen in informal tournaments Its scoring is similar to match play except each player compares their hole score to the hole s par rating instead of the score of another player The player wins the hole if they score a birdie or better they lose the hole if they score a bogey or worse and they halve the hole by scoring par By recording only this simple win loss halve score on the sheet a player can shrug off a very poorly played hole with a simple mark and move on As used in competitions the player or pair with the best win loss differential wins the competition The Stableford system is a simplification of stroke play that awards players points based on their score relative to the hole s par the score for a hole is calculated by taking the par score adding 2 then subtracting the player s hole score making the result zero if negative Alternately stated a double bogey or worse is zero points a bogey is worth one point par is two a birdie three an eagle four and so on The advantages of this system over stroke play are a more natural higher is better scoring the ability to compare Stableford scores between plays on courses with different total par scores scoring an even in stroke play will always give a Stableford score of 36 discouraging the tendency to abandon the entire game after playing a particularly bad hole a novice playing by strict rules may score as high as an 8 or 10 on a single difficult hole their Stableford score for the hole would be zero which puts them only two points behind par no matter how badly they played and the ability to simply pick up one s ball once it is impossible to score any points for the hole which speeds play The USGA and R A sanction a Modified Stableford system for scratch players which makes par worth zero a birdie worth 2 eagle 5 and double eagle 8 while a bogey is a penalty of −1 and a double bogey or worse −3 As with the original system the highest score wins the game and terrible scores on one or two holes will not ruin a player s overall score but this system rewards bogey birdie play more than the original encouraging golfers to try to make riskier birdie putt or eagle chipshots instead of simply parring each hole 17 A handicap is a numerical measure of a golfer s potential scoring ability over 18 holes It is used to enable players of widely varying abilities to compete against one another Better players are those with the lowest handicaps and someone with a handicap of 0 or less is often referred to as a scratch golfer Handicap systems vary throughout the world and use different methods to assess courses and calculate handicaps In order to address difficulties in translating between these systems the USGA and The R A working with the various existing handicapping authorities devised a new World Handicap System which is set to be introduced globally starting in 2020 46 Golf courses are assessed and rated according to the average good score of a scratch golfer taking into account a multitude of factors affecting play such as length obstacles undulations etc A player s handicap gives an indication of the number of strokes above this course rating that the player will make over the course of an average best round of golf i e scoring near their potential above average 47 Lower handicap players are generally the most consistent so can be expected to play to this standard or better more often than higher handicappers Some handicap systems also account for differences in scoring difficulty between low and high handicap golfer They do this by means of assessing and rating courses according to the average good score of a bogey golfer a player with a handicap of around 20 This is used with the course rating to calculate a slope rating which is used to adjust golfer s handicap to produce a playing handicap for the course and set of tees being used 48 Handicap systems have potential for abuse by players who may intentionally play badly to increase their handicap sandbagging before playing to their potential at an important event with a valuable prize For this reason handicaps are not used in professional golf but they can still be calculated and used along with other criteria to determine the relative strengths of various professional players Touring professionals being the best of the best have negative handicaps they can be expected more often than not to score lower than the Course Rating on any course In 2005 Golf Digest calculated that the countries with most golf courses per capita in order were Scotland New Zealand Australia Ireland Canada Wales United States Sweden and England countries with fewer than 500 000 people were excluded The number of courses in other territories has increased an example of this being the expansion of golf in China The first golf course in China opened in 1984 but by the end of 2009 there were roughly 600 in the country For much of the 21st century development of new golf courses in China has been officially banned with the exception of the island province of Hainan but the number of courses had nonetheless tripled from 2004 to 2009 the ban has been evaded with the government s tacit approval simply by not mentioning golf in any development plans 49 In the United States the number of people who play golf twenty five times or more per year decreased from 6 9 million in 2000 to 4 6 million in 2005 50 according to the National Golf Foundation The NGF reported that the number who played golf at all decreased from 30 to 26 million over the same period 50 In February 1971 astronaut Alan Shepard became the first person to golf anywhere other than Earth He smuggled a golf club and two golf balls on board Apollo 14 with the intent to golf on the Moon He attempted two drives He shanked the first attempt but it is estimated his second went more than 200 yards 180 m 51 Number of golf courses by country in 2015 Below are the top 18 countries that have the most golf courses 52 The majority of professional golfers work as club or teaching professionals pros and only compete in local competitions A small elite of professional golfers are tournament pros who compete full time on international tours Many club and teaching professionals working in the golf industry start as caddies or with a general interest in the game finding employment at golf courses and eventually moving on to certifications in their chosen profession These programs include independent institutions and universities and those that eventually lead to a Class A golf professional certification Touring professionals typically start as amateur players who attain their pro status after success in major tournaments that win them either prize money and or notice from corporate sponsors Jack Nicklaus for example gained widespread notice by finishing second in the 1960 U S Open to champion Arnold Palmer with a 72 hole score of 282 the best score to date in that tournament by an amateur He played one more amateur year in 1961 winning that year s U S Amateur Championship before turning pro in 1962 Golf instruction involves the teaching and learning of the game of golf Proficiency in teaching golf instruction requires not only technical and physical ability but also knowledge of the rules and etiquette of the game In some countries golf instruction is best performed by teachers certified by the Professional Golfers Association Some top instructors who work with professional golfers have become quite well known in their own right Professional golf instructors can use physical conditioning mental visualization classroom sessions club fitting driving range instruction on course play under real conditions and review of videotaped swings in slow motion to teach golf to prepare the golfer for the course There are at least twenty professional golf tours each run by a PGA or an independent tour organization which is responsible for arranging events finding sponsors and regulating the tour Typically a tour has members who are entitled to compete in most of its events and also invites non members to compete in some of them Gaining membership of an elite tour is highly competitive and most professional golfers never achieve it Perhaps the most widely known tour is the PGA Tour which tends to attract the strongest fields outside the four Majors and the four World Golf Championships events This is due mostly to the fact that most PGA Tour events have a first prize of at least 800 000 USD The European Tour which attracts a substantial number of top golfers from outside North America ranks second to the PGA Tour in worldwide prestige Some top professionals from outside North America play enough tournaments to maintain membership on both the PGA Tour and European Tour Since 2010 both tours money titles have been claimed by the same individual three times with Luke Donald doing so in 2011 and Rory McIlroy in 2012 and 2014 In 2013 Henrik Stenson won the FedEx Cup points race on the PGA Tour and the European Tour money title but did not top the PGA Tour money list that honour going to Tiger Woods The other leading men s tours include the Japan Golf Tour the Asian Tour Asia outside Japan the PGA Tour of Australasia and the Sunshine Tour for southern Africa primarily South Africa The Japan Australasian Sunshine PGA and European Tours are the charter members of the trade body of the world s main tours the International Federation of PGA Tours founded in 1996 The Asian Tour became a full member in 1999 The Canadian Tour became an associate member of the Federation in 2000 and the Tour de las Américas Latin America became an associate member of the Federation in 2007 The Federation underwent a major expansion in 2009 that saw eleven new tours become full members – the Canadian Tour Tour de las Américas China Golf Association the Korea Professional Golfers Association Professional Golf Tour of India and the operators of all six major women s tours worldwide The OneAsia Tour founded in 2009 is not a member of the Federation but was founded as a joint venture of the Australasia China Japan and Korean tours In 2011 the Tour de las Américas was effectively taken over by the PGA Tour and in 2012 was folded into the new PGA Tour Latinoamérica Also in 2012 the Canadian Tour was renamed PGA Tour Canada after it agreed to be taken over by the PGA Tour All men s tours that are Federation members except the India tour offer points in the Official World Golf Ranking OWGR to players who place sufficiently high in their events The OneAsia Tour also offers ranking points Golf is unique in having lucrative competition for older players There are several senior tours for men aged fifty and over arguably the best known of which is the U S based PGA Tour Champions There are six principal tours for women each based in a different country or continent The most prestigious of these is the United States based LPGA Tour All of the principal tours offer points in the Women s World Golf Rankings for high finishers in their events All of the leading professional tours for under 50 players have an official developmental tour in which the leading players at the end of the season will earn a tour card on the main tour for the following season Examples include the Web com Tour which feeds to the PGA Tour and the Challenge Tour which is the developmental tour of the European Tour The Web com and Challenge Tours also offer OWGR points The major championships are the four most prestigious men s tournaments of the year In chronological order they are The Masters the U S Open The Open Championship referred to in North America as the British Open and the PGA Championship 53 The fields for these events include the top several dozen golfers from all over the world The Masters has been played at Augusta National Golf Club in Augusta Georgia since its inception in 1934 It is the only major championship that is played at the same course each year 54 The U S Open and PGA Championship are played at courses around the United States while the Open Championship is played at courses around the United Kingdom 55 Prior to the advent of the PGA Championship and The Masters the four Majors were the U S Open the U S Amateur the Open Championship and the British Amateur Women s golf does not have a globally agreed set of majors The list of majors recognised by the dominant women s tour the LPGA Tour in the U S has changed several times over the years with the most recent changes occurring in 2001 and 2013 Like the PGA Tour the U S LPGA 56 tour long had four majors but now has five the ANA Inspiration previously known by several other names most recently the Kraft Nabisco Championship the Women s PGA Championship previously known as the LPGA Championship 57 the U S Women s Open the Women s British Open which replaced the du Maurier Classic as a major in 2001 and The Evian Championship added as the fifth major in 2013 Only the last two are also recognised as majors by the Ladies European Tour However the significance of this is limited as the LPGA is far more dominant in women s golf than the PGA Tour is in mainstream men s golf For example the BBC has been known to use the U S definition of women s majors without qualifying it Also the Ladies Golf Union the governing body for women s golf in Great Britain and Ireland stated on its official website that the Women s British Open was the only Women s Major to be played outside the U S 58 this was before the elevation of The Evian Championship to major status For many years the Ladies European Tour tacitly acknowledged the dominance of the LPGA Tour by not scheduling any of its own events to conflict with the three LPGA majors played in the U S but that changed beginning in 2008 when the LET scheduled an event opposite the LPGA Championship The second richest women s tour the LPGA of Japan Tour does not recognise any of the U S LPGA or European majors as it has its own set of majors historically three since 2008 four However these events attract little notice outside Japan Senior aged fifty and over men s golf does not have a globally agreed set of majors The list of senior majors on the U S based PGA Tour Champions has changed over the years but always by expansion PGA Tour Champions now recognises five majors the Senior PGA Championship The Tradition the Senior Players Championship the United States Senior Open and The Senior British Open Championship Of the five events the Senior PGA is by far the oldest having been founded in 1937 The other events all date from the 1980s when senior golf became a commercial success as the first golf stars of the television era such as Arnold Palmer and Gary Player reached the relevant age The Senior Open Championship was not recognised as a major by PGA Tour Champions until 2003 The European Senior Tour recognises only the Senior PGA and the two Senior Opens as majors However PGA Tour Champions is arguably more dominant in global senior golf than the U S LPGA is in global women s golf After a 112 year absence from the Olympic Games golf returned for the 2016 Rio Games 59 41 different countries were represented by 120 athletes 60 It was not until 1552 that the first woman golfer played the game Mary Queen of Scots commissioned St Andrew s Links 61 However it was not until the 20th century that women were taken seriously and eventually broke the Gentlemen Only Ladies Forbidden rule Many men saw women as unfit to play the sport due to their supposed lack of strength and ability In 1891 the newly built Shinnecock Hills nine hole course in Southampton New York became the first club to offer membership to women golfers Four years later in 1895 The U S Golf Association held the first Women s Amateur Championship tournament 61 62 Just like professional golfer Bobby Jones Joyce Wethered was considered to be a star in the 1920s 63 Jones praised Wethered in 1930 after they had played an exhibition against each other He doubted that there had ever been a better golfer man or woman 64 However Bobby Jones comment was not enough for others to change their views on women golfers The Royal Liverpool s club refused entry of Sir Henry Cotton s wife into the clubhouse in the late 1940s The secretary of the club released a statement saying No woman ever has entered the clubhouse and praise God no woman ever will 63 However American golfer and all around athlete Babe Zaharias did not have to enter the clubhouse She was able to prove herself on the course going on to become the first American to win the British Women s Amateur title in 1947 The following year she became the first woman to attempt to qualify for the U S Open but her application was rejected by the USGA They stated that the event was intended to be open to men only 65 The Ladies Professional Golf Association was formed in 1950 as a way to popularize the sport and provide competitive opportunities for golfers 63 The competitions were not the same for the men and women It was not until 1972 that U S Congress passed the Title IX of the Education Amendments No person in the United States shall on the basis of sex be excluded from participation in be denied the benefits of or be subject to discrimination under any education program or activities receiving Federal financial assistance 66 American Renee Powell moved to the UK in the 1970s to further her career and became the first woman to play in a British men s tournament in 1977 67 Today women golfers are still fighting to have the same opportunities as men golfers There is still a big pay gap in the USGA The USGA has a long history of writing bigger checks to winners of the men s U S Open than the U S Women s Open 68 Golf Contents Origin and history Golf course Play of the game Rules and regulations Equipment Stroke mechanics Scoring and handicapping Popularity

junior membership offered by the members of Glen Garden Club rules did not allow caddies age 16 and older so after August 1928 Hogan took his game to three scrubby daily fee courses Katy Lake Worth Hills and Z Boaz Hogan dropped out of Central High School during the final semester of his senior year He turned pro in the golf industry six months shy of his 18th birthday at the Texas Open in San Antonio in late January 1930 Hogan met Valerie Fox in Sunday school in Fort Worth in the mid 1920s and they reacquainted in 1932 when he landed a low paying club pro job in Cleburne where her family had moved They married in April 1935 at her parents home Hogan s early years as a pro were very difficult he went broke more than once He did not win his first tournament as an individual until March 1940 6 7 when he won three consecutive events in North Carolina at age 27 8 9 Although it took a decade for Hogan to secure his first victory his wife Valerie believed in him and this helped see him through the tough years when he battled a hook that he later cured Despite finishing 13th on the money list in 1938 Hogan took an assistant pro job at Century Country Club in Purchase New York He worked at Century as an assistant and then as the head pro until 1941 when he took the head pro job at Hershey Country Club in Hershey Pennsylvania During Hogan s prime years of 1938 through 1959 he won 63 professional golf tournaments despite the interruption of his career by World War II and a near fatal car accident Hogan served in the U S Army Air Forces from March 1943 to June 1945 he was stationed locally at Fort Worth and became a utility pilot with the rank of lieutenant Driving home to Fort Worth after a Monday playoff loss at the 1949 Phoenix Open 10 Hogan and his wife Valerie survived a head on collision with a Greyhound bus east of Van Horn Texas On the morning of Wednesday February 2 Hogan had reduced his speed in the limited visibility ground fog the bus was attempting to pass another vehicle on a narrow bridge which left no place to avoid the crash Hogan threw himself across Valerie in order to protect her He would have been killed had he not done so because the steering column punctured the driver s seat of their new Cadillac sedan 11 12 This accident left Hogan age 36 with a double fracture of the pelvis a fractured collar bone a left ankle fracture a chipped rib and near fatal blood clots he would suffer lifelong circulation problems and other physical limitations His doctors said he might never walk again let alone play golf competitively While Hogan was in the hospital in El Paso his life was endangered by a blood clot problem that led doctors to tie off the vena cava He left the hospital on the first of April 59 days after the accident and returned to Fort Worth by train 13 14 Hogan regained his strength by extensive walking and resumed his golf activities in November 1949 He returned to the PGA Tour to start the 1950 season at the Los Angeles Open where he tied with Sam Snead over 72 holes but lost the 18 hole playoff held over a week later due to course conditions 15 16 The win at Carnoustie was only a part of Hogan s watershed 1953 season a year in which he won five of the six tournaments he entered including three major championships a feat known as the Triple Crown of Golf 17 It still stands among the greatest single seasons in the history of professional golf Hogan 40 was unable to enter—and possibly win—the 1953 PGA Championship to complete the Grand Slam because its play July 1–7 overlapped the play of The Open at Carnoustie July 6–10 which he won It was the only time that a golfer had won three major professional championships in a year until Tiger Woods won the final three majors in 2000 and the first in 2001 Hogan often declined to play in the PGA Championship he skipped it more and more often as his career wore on There were two reasons for this First the PGA Championship was until 1958 a match play event and Hogan s particular skill was shooting a number —meticulously planning and executing a strategy to achieve a score for a round on a particular course even to the point of leaving out the 7 iron in the U S Open at Merion saying there are no 7 iron shots at Merion Second the PGA required several days of 36 holes per day competition and after his 1949 auto accident Hogan struggled to manage more than 18 holes a day After the win at Carnoustie Hogan and his wife Valerie were passengers on the SS United States westbound to New York City where he received a ticker tape parade down Broadway on July 21 18 19 Ben Hogan is widely acknowledged to be one of the greatest ball strikers who ever played golf Although he had a formidable record with 64 PGA tour victories it is Hogan s ball striking ability that mostly underpins his modern reputation Hogan was known to practice more than any of his contemporary golfers and is said to have invented practice On this matter Hogan himself said You hear stories about me beating my brains out practicing but I was enjoying myself I couldn t wait to get up in the morning so I could hit balls When I m hitting the ball where I want hard and crisply it s a joy that very few people experience 20 He was also one of the first players to match particular clubs to yardages or reference points around the course such as bunkers or trees in order to improve his distance control Hogan thought that an individual s golf swing was in the dirt and that mastering it required plenty of practice and repetition He is also known to have spent years contemplating the golf swing trying a range of theories and methods before arriving at the finished method which brought him his greatest period of success The young Hogan was badly afflicted by hooking the golf ball Although slight of build at 5 8½ and 145 pounds 21 – attributes that earned him the nickname Bantam which he thoroughly disliked – he was long off the tee early in his career Like many professional golfers of his day he competed in long drive contests as well as matchplay and strokeplay events It has been alleged that Hogan used a strong grip with hands more the right of the club grip in tournament play prior to his accident in 1949 despite often practicing with a weak grip with the back of the left wrist facing the target and that this limited his success or at least his reliability up to that date 22 Jacobs alleges that Byron Nelson told him this information and furthermore that Hogan developed and used the strong grip as a boy in order to be able to hit the ball as far as bigger stronger contemporaries This strong grip is what resulted in Hogan hitting the odd disastrous snap hook Hogan s late swing produced the famed Hogan Fade ball flight lower than usual for a great player and from left to right This ball flight was the result of his using a draw type swing in conjunction with a weak grip a combination that all but negated the chance of hitting a hook Hogan played and practiced golf with only bare hands i e without wearing gloves Moe Norman did the same playing and practicing without gloves The two were arguably the greatest ball strikers golf has ever known even Tiger Woods quoted them as the only players ever to have owned their swings in that they had total control of it and as a result the ball s flight 23 In May 1967 the editor of Cary Middlecoff s 1974 book The Golf Swing watched every shot that 54 year old Hogan hit in the Colonial National Invitational in Fort Worth Texas Hogan shot 281 for a third place tie with George Archer Of the 281 shots 141 were taken in reaching the greens Of the 141 139 were rated from well executed to superbly executed The remaining two were a drive that missed the fairway by some 5 yards and a 5 iron to a par 3 hole that missed the green by about the same distance It was difficult if not impossible to conceive of anybody hitting the ball better over a four day span 24 In the spring of 1953 Hogan announced he had discovered a secret that made his swing nearly automatic 25 There are many theories as to its exact nature The earliest theory is that the secret was a special wrist movement known as cupping under This information was revealed in a 1955 Life magazine article However many believed Hogan did not reveal all that he knew at the time It has since been alleged in Golf Digest magazine and by Jody Vasquez in his book Afternoons With Mr Hogan that the second element of Hogan s secret was the way in which he used his right knee to initiate the swing and that this right knee movement was critical to the correct operation of the wrist Hogan revealed later in life that the secret involved cupping the left wrist at the top of the backswing and using a weaker left hand grip thumb more on top of the grip as opposed to on the right side Hogan did this to prevent himself from ever hooking the ball off the tee By positioning his hands in this manner he ensured that the club face would be slightly open upon impact creating a fade left to right ball flight as opposed to a draw or hook right to left ball flight Many believed that although he played right handed as an adult Hogan was actually left handed In his book Five Lessons in the chapter entitled The Grip Hogan said I was born left handed that was the normal way for me to do things I was switched over to doing things right handed when I was a boy but I started golf as a left hander because the first club I ever came into possession of an old five iron was a left handed stick This belief also seemed to be corroborated by Hogan himself in his earlier book Power Golf However some mystery still remains about this since Hogan in subsequent interviews said that the belief of his being left handed was actually a myth noted in what was probably his last video interview and in his 1987 Golf Magazine interview In these interviews Hogan said that he was indeed a right handed player who early on practiced played with a left hand club that had been given to him because it was all that he had and that it was this issue that brought about the myth that he was left handed This may be the reason that his early play with right handed equipment found him using a cross handed grip right hand at the end of the club left hand below it In The Search for the Perfect Golf Swing researchers Cochran and Stobbs held the opinion that a left handed person playing right handed would be prone to hook the ball Hy Peskin a staff photographer for Sports Illustrated took a famous photo of Ben Hogan playing a 1 iron shot to the green at the 72nd hole of the 1950 U S Open 26 It was ranked by Sports Illustrated as one of the greatest sports photographs of the 20th century 27 Hogan believed that a solid repeatable golf swing involved only a few essential elements which when performed correctly and in sequence were the essence of the swing His book Five Lessons The Modern Fundamentals of Golf written with Herbert Warren Wind is perhaps the most widely read golf tutorial ever written although Harvey Penick s Little Red Book would also have a claim to that title and the principles therein are often parroted by modern swing gurus In the Five Lessons Hogan breaks down the swing into four parts The Fundamentals The Grip Stance and Posture and The Swing Hogan explains that the average golfer underestimates himself He believes that beginners place too much emphasis on the long game If you have a correct powerful and repeating swing then you can shoot in the 70s The average golfer is entirely capable of building a repeating swing and breaking 80 28 Through years of trial and error Ben has developed techniques that have proved themselves under various types of pressure Hogan says Good golf begins with a good grip 28 Without a good grip one cannot play to his or her potential The grip is important because it is the only direct physical contact you have with the ball via your golf club A bad grip can cause dipping of the hands at the top of the swing and a decrease in club head speed This can cause a loss of power and accuracy The following describes the perfect golf grip in the eyes of Mr Hogan With the back of your left hand facing the target place the club in the left hand so that 1 The shaft is pressed up under the muscular pad at the inside heel of the palm and 2 The shaft also lies directly across the top joint of the forefinger 28 Crook the forefinger around the shaft and you will discover that you can lift the club and maintain a fairly firm grip on it by supporting it just with the muscles of that finger and the muscles of the pad of the palm 28 Now just close the left hand close the fingers before you close the thumb and the club will be just where it should be 28 To gain a real acquaintance with this preparatory guide to correct gripping I would suggest practicing it five or 10 minutes a day for a week until it begins to become second nature 28 To obtain the proper grip with the right hand hold it somewhat extended with the palm facing your target Now your left hand is already correctly affixed place the club in your right hand so that the shaft lies across the top joint of the four fingers and definitely below the palm 28 The right hand is a finger grip The two fingers which should apply most of the pressure are the two middle fingers 28 Now with the club held firmly on the fingers of your right hand simply fold your right hand over your left thumb 28 The right stance not only allows for proper alignment but also for a balanced swing prepared usage of the proper muscles and the maximum strength and control over your swing We align our body to the target only after we have aligned the club head to the target A proper stance starts with your feet being aligned at the target followed by your knees hips and shoulders Your feet should be shoulder width apart your front foot should be slightly opened towards the target and your back foot should be perpendicular to the target As you increase in club your stance should widen for further stability Your shoulders will be naturally open to the target line because your arms are not at equal length while holding the club Make sure to close your shoulders slightly to stay aligned with the target line The proper stance affects how controlled the backswing is governs the amount of hip turn in the backswing and allows for the hips to clear through the downswing Your front arm should be extended at all times to allow the club to travel in its maximum arc The elbows should be tucked in not stuck out from the body At address the left elbow should point directly at the left hipbone and the right elbow should point directly at the right hipbone Furthermore there should be a sense of fixed jointness between the two forearms and the wrists and it should be maintained throughout the swing 28 You should bend your knees from the thighs down As your knees bend the upper part of the trunk remains normally erect just as it does when you sit down in a chair In golf the sit down motion is more like lowering yourself onto a spectator sports stick Think of the seat of the stick as being about two inches or so below your buttocks 28 Hogan advocates the use of a waggle not only because it helps you loosen your muscles but also because it allows for your hands and arms to remember where to go for the first part of your backswing The angle of the swing should feel like you are swinging under a slanting plane of glass The glass has a hole for your head while it rests on your shoulders and touches the ground on top of your ball Also the backswing should be slightly steeper than the downswing At the top of your backswing your back should be facing the target On the backswing the order of movement goes like this hands arms shoulders hips 28 Actually the hands start the club head back a split second before the arms start back And the arms begin their movement a split second before the shoulders begin to turn 28 Just before your hands reach hip level the shoulders as they turn automatically start pulling the hips around As the hips begin to turn they pull the left leg in to the right 28 When you have turned your shoulders all the way your back should face squarely toward your target 28 When you finish your backswing your chin should be hitting against the top of your left shoulder 28 As you begin the backswing you must restrain your hips from moving until the turning of the shoulders starts to pull the hips around…It is this increased tension that unwinds the upper part of the body It unwinds the shoulder the arms and the hands in that order the correct order It helps the swing so much it makes it almost automatic 28 If he executes his backswing properly as his arms are approaching hip level they should be parallel with the plane and they should remain parallel with the plane just beneath the glass till they reach the top of the backswing At the top of his backswing his left arm should be extended at the exact same angle to the ball as the glass 28 Hogan believes the second part of the swing the downswing is initiated by the hips starting to turn A baseball player throws a ball by transferring his weight and rotates his hips Then his shoulders and arm follow after Hogan thinks that the downswing is very similar to this action The downswing is at a slightly shallower angle and therefore the arms and hands should come from the inside out on the downswing The club head reaches its maximum speed not at impact but right after when both arms are fully extended At impact the back of the left hand faces toward your target The wrist bone is definitely raised It points to the target and at the moment the ball is contacted it is out in front nearer to the target than any part of the hand 28 At impact the right arm is still bent slightly 28 At that point just beyond impact where both arms are straight and extended the club head reaches its maximum speed 28 The hips lead the shoulders all the way on the downswing 28 The Five Lessons were initially released as a five part series in Sports Illustrated magazine beginning with the issue of March 11 1957 29 It was compiled and printed in book form later that year and is currently in its 64th printing Even today it continues to maintain a place at or near the top of the Amazon com golf book sales rankings The book was co authored by Herbert Warren Wind and illustrated by artist Anthony Ravielli Hogan is widely acknowledged to have been one of the finest ball strikers that ever played the game Hogan s ball striking has also been described as being of near miraculous caliber by other very knowledgeable observers such as Jack Nicklaus who only saw him play some years after his prime Nicklaus once responded to the question Is Tiger Woods the best ball striker you have ever seen with No no Ben Hogan easily 30 Further testimony to Hogan s and Moe Norman s status among top golfers is provided by Tiger Woods who recently when said that he wished to own his golf swing in the same way as Moe Norman and Hogan had Woods claimed that this pair were the only players ever to have owned their swings in that they had total control of it and as a result of the ball s flight 23 By most accounts Ben Hogan was the best golfer of his era and still stands as one of the greatest of all time The Hawk possessed fierce determination and an iron will which combined with his unquestionable golf skills formed an aura that could intimidate opponents into competitive submission In Scotland Hogan was known as The Wee Ice Man or in some versions Wee Ice Mon a moniker earned during his famous British Open victory at Carnoustie in 1953 31 It is a reference to his steely and seemingly nerveless demeanor itself a product of a golf swing he had built that was designed to perform better the more pressure he put it under Hogan rarely spoke during competition and mostly kept to himself Hogan was also highly respected by fellow competitors for his superb course management skills During his peak years he rarely if ever attempted a shot in competition which he had not thoroughly honed in practice Although his ball striking was perhaps the greatest ever Hogan s putting skills are thought to have been below average though he was capable of putting very well Solid and sometimes spectacular in his early and peak years Hogan by his later years deteriorated to the point of being an often poor putter by professional standards particularly on slow greens The majority of his putting problems developed after his 1949 car accident which nearly blinded his left eye and impaired his depth perception Toward the end of his career he often stood over the ball inordinately long before drawing his putter back While he suffered from the yips in his later years 32 Hogan was known as an effective putter from mid to short range on quick U S Open style surfaces at times during his career Ben Hogan won ten tournaments in 1948 alone including the U S Open at Riviera Country Club a course known as Hogan s Alley because of his success there His 8 under par score in 1948 set a U S Open record that was matched only by Jack Nicklaus in 1980 Hale Irwin in 1990 and Lee Janzen in 1993 It was not broken until Tiger Woods shot 12 under par in 2000 Jim Furyk also shot 8 under par in the 2003 Rory McIlroy set the current record with 16 under par in 2011 which was matched by Brooks Koepka in 2017 Hogan remains the only player to win at least 10 PGA tour events in a year twice 13 in 1946 10 in 1948 Hogan owns the longest streaks of consecutive major attempts finishing in both the top 5 with 12 1940 1947 the top 10 with 18 1948 1956 Hogan is the only player to win as many as 8 majors in as few as 11 attempts 1948 1953 Hogan is the only player to finish in the top 2 in more than 15 PGA tour events 2 different years 16 in 1941 20 in 1946 Hogan owns the longest streak of consecutive U S Open attempts finishing in the top 10 with 16 1940 1960 The next longest streak is 7 Hogan is one of only 2 players to ever win 3 consecutive U S Opens in 3 attempts the other is Willie Anderson Hogan finished top 10 and scored UNDER 290 in 12 consecutive U S Open attempts 1941 1956 which is the longest such streak in Open history He did it on 12 different courses and won 5 times Despite technological advances in the game which always lowers scores the next longest streak remains just 4 To further put this incomparable sports achievement into perspective consider the following In the 1970 US Open Nicklaus Palmer Player all failed to break 300! AND Tiger Woods during this ultimate technological century failed to finish top 10 break 290 4 times 2004 06 13 15 between age 21 39 while finishing top 10 only 8 total times during his career Hogan is the only player to win 3 majors in 3 consecutive starts 2 different times 1950 51 1953 All these achievements of course include the Hale America National Open Colonial Country Club in Fort Worth a modern PGA Tour tournament venue is also known as Hogan s Alley and may have the better claim to the nickname as he won its tour event five times It was his home course after his retirement and he was an active member of Colonial as well for many years The sixth hole at Carnoustie a par five on which Hogan took a famously difficult line off the tee during each of his rounds in the 1953 Open Championship has also recently been renamed Hogan s Alley Prior to the 1949 accident Hogan never truly captured the hearts of his galleries despite being one of the best golfers of his time Perhaps this was due to his perceived cold and aloof on course persona But when Hogan shocked and amazed the golf world by returning to tournament golf only eleven months after his accident and took second place in the 1950 Los Angeles Open after a playoff loss to Sam Snead he was cheered on by ecstatic fans His legs simply were not strong enough to carry his heart any longer famed sportswriter Grantland Rice said of Hogan s near miss However he proved to his critics and to himself especially that he could still win by completing his famous comeback five months later defeating Lloyd Mangrum and George Fazio in an 18 hole playoff at Merion near Philadelphia to win his second U S Open title Hogan went on to achieve what is perhaps the greatest sporting accomplishment in history limping to twelve more PGA Tour wins including six majors before retiring In 1951 Hogan entered just five events but won three of them the Masters U S Open and World Championship of Golf and finished second and fourth in his other two starts He finished fourth on that season s money list barely $6 000 behind the season s official money list leader Lloyd Mangrum who played over twenty events That year also saw the release of a biopic starring Glenn Ford as Hogan called Follow the Sun The Ben Hogan Story 33 He even received a ticker tape parade in New York City in 1953 upon his return from winning the British Open the only time he played the event With that victory Hogan became just the second player after Gene Sarazen to win all four of the modern major championships—the Masters U S Open British Open and PGA Championship Hogan remains the only player to win the Masters U S Open and British Open in the same calendar year 1953 His 14 under par at the 1953 Masters set a record that stood for a dozen years as of 2018 he remains one of just twelve Jack Nicklaus Raymond Floyd Ben Crenshaw Tiger Woods David Duval Phil Mickelson Charl Schwartzel Jordan Spieth Justin Rose Rickie Fowler and Patrick Reed to have recorded such a low score in the tournament In 1967 at age 54 Hogan shot a record 30 on the back nine at the Masters the record stood until 1992 In 1945 Hogan set a PGA Tour record for a 72 hole event at the Portland Open Invitational by shooting 27 under par The record stood until 1998 when it was broken by John Huston it has since been surpassed by nine others including most recently Phil Mickelson s 28 under in the 2013 Waste Management Phoenix Open 34 Hogan never competed on the Senior PGA Tour as that circuit did not exist until he was in his late sixties According to his PGA Tour profile 35 Hogan earned just $332 516 in official PGA events however a 2021 study concluded that Hogan s tournament performances could have earned him $91 8M if he had played in the modern era 36 Many supporters of Hogan and some golf historians feel that his victory at the Hale America Open in 1942 should be counted as his fifth U S Open and 10th major championship since the tournament was to be a substitute for the Open after its cancellation by the USGA The Hale America National Open was held in the same time slot and was run like the U S Open with more than 1 500 entries local qualifying at 69 sites and sectional qualifying at most major cities The top players who were not away fighting in World War II participated and the largest purse of the year was awarded Included in the field were all the very top players of the day including Byron Nelson Gene Sarazen Jimmy Demaret Lloyd Mangrum defending Open champ Craig Wood The only player of that level who did not play was Sam Snead but the field did also include Bobby Jones who had competed in his own Masters event in April of that year 37 38 39 Following his most successful season Hogan started his golf club company in the fall of 1953 in Fort Worth Production began in the summer of 1954 with clubs targeted toward the better player Always a perfectionist Hogan is said to have ordered the entire first production run of clubs destroyed because they did not meet his exacting standards In 1960 he sold the company to American Machine and Foundry AMF but stayed on as chairman of the board for several more years AMF Ben Hogan golf clubs were sold continuously from 1960 to 1985 when AMF was bought by Minstar who sold The Ben Hogan company in 1988 to Cosmo World who owned the club manufacturer until 1992 when it was sold to another independent investor Bill Goodwin Goodwin moved the company out of Fort Worth and a union shop to Virginia so it would be close to his home of operations for other AMF brands and incidentally a non union shop in an effort to return the company to profitability Goodwin sold to Spalding in 1997 closing the sale in January 1998 Spalding returned manufacturing to Hogan s Fort Worth before eventually including the company s assets in a bankruptcy sale of Spalding s Top Flite division to Callaway in 2004 Callaway now owns the rights to the Ben Hogan brand After over a half century and numerous ownership changes the Ben Hogan line was discontinued by Callaway in 2008 In May 2014 Eldolon Brands approached Perry Ellis International and got the rights to use Ben Hogan s name for a line of golf clubs 42 43 Hogan died at age 84 in Fort Worth on July 25 1997 2 3 4 his wife Valerie died two years later 45 and they are interred at Greenwood Memorial Park in Fort Worth

Quincy Adams Another son Jeb Bush unsuccessfully sought the Republican presidential nomination in the 2016 Republican primaries Historians generally rank Bush as an above average president George Herbert Walker Bush was born in Milton Massachusetts 2 on June 12 1924 He was the second son of Prescott Bush and Dorothy Walker Bush 3 His paternal grandfather Samuel P Bush worked as an executive for a railroad parts company in Columbus Ohio 4 while his maternal grandfather and namesake George Herbert Walker led Wall Street investment bank W A Harriman Co 5 Walker was known as Pop and young Bush was called Poppy as a tribute to him 6 The Bush family moved to Greenwich Connecticut in 1925 and Prescott took a position with W A Harriman Co which later merged into Brown Brothers Harriman Co the following year 7 Bush spent most of his childhood in Greenwich at the family vacation home in Kennebunkport Maine b or at his maternal grandparents plantation in South Carolina 9 Because of the family s wealth Bush was largely unaffected by the Great Depression 10 He attended Greenwich Country Day School from 1929 to 1937 and Phillips Academy an elite private academy in Massachusetts from 1937 to 1942 11 While at Phillips Academy he served as president of the senior class secretary of the student council president of the community fund raising group a member of the editorial board of the school newspaper and captain of the varsity baseball and soccer teams 12 On his 18th birthday immediately after graduating from Phillips Academy he enlisted in the United States Navy as a naval aviator 13 After a period of training he was commissioned as an ensign in the Naval Reserve at Naval Air Station Corpus Christi on June 9 1943 becoming one of the youngest aviators in the Navy 14 c Beginning in 1944 Bush served in the Pacific theater where he flew a Grumman TBF Avenger a torpedo bomber capable of taking off from aircraft carriers 19 His squadron was assigned to the USS San Jacinto as a member of Air Group 51 where his lanky physique earned him the nickname Skin 20 Bush flew his first combat mission in May 1944 bombing Japanese held Wake Island 21 and was promoted to lieutenant junior grade on August 1 1944 During an attack on a Japanese installation in Chichijima Bush s aircraft successfully attacked several targets but was downed by enemy fire 18 Though both of Bush s fellow crew members died Bush successfully bailed out from the aircraft and was rescued by the USS Finback 22 d Several of the aviators shot down during the attack were captured and executed and their livers were eaten by their captors 23 Bush s survival after such a close brush with death shaped him profoundly leading him to ask Why had I been spared and what did God have for me 24 He was later awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for his role in the mission 25 Bush returned to San Jacinto in November 1944 participating in operations in the Philippines In early 1945 he was assigned to a new combat squadron VT 153 where he trained to take part in an invasion of mainland Japan On September 2 1945 before any invasion took place Japan formally surrendered following the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki 26 Bush was released from active duty that same month but was not formally discharged from the Navy until October 1955 at which point he had reached the rank of lieutenant 18 By the end of his period of active service Bush had flown 58 missions completed 128 carrier landings and recorded 1228 hours of flight time 27 Bush met Barbara Pierce at a Christmas dance in Greenwich in December 1941 28 and after a period of courtship they became engaged in December 1943 29 While Bush was on leave from the Navy they married in Rye New York on January 6 1945 30 The Bushes enjoyed a strong marriage and Barbara would later be a popular First Lady seen by many as a kind of national grandmother 31 e They have six children George W b 1946 Robin 1949 1953 Jeb b 1953 Neil b 1955 Marvin b 1956 and Doro b 1959 13 Their oldest daughter Robin died of leukemia in 1953 34 Bush enrolled at Yale College where he took part in an accelerated program that enabled him to graduate in two and a half years rather than the usual four 13 He was a member of the Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity and was elected its president 35 He also captained the Yale baseball team and played in the first two College World Series as a left handed first baseman 36 Like his father he was a member of the Yale cheerleading squad 37 and was initiated into the Skull and Bones secret society He graduated Phi Beta Kappa in 1948 with a Bachelor of Arts degree majoring in economics and minoring in sociology 38 After graduating from Yale Bush moved his young family to West Texas Biographer Jon Meacham writes that Bush s relocation to Texas allowed him to move out of the daily shadow of his Wall Street father and Grandfather Walker two dominant figures in the financial world but would still allow Bush to call on their connections if he needed to raise capital 39 His first position in Texas was an oil field equipment salesman 40 for Dresser Industries which was led by family friend Neil Mallon 41 While working for Dresser Bush lived in various places with his family Odessa Texas Ventura Bakersfield and Compton California and Midland Texas 42 In 1952 he volunteered for the successful presidential campaign of Republican candidate Dwight D Eisenhower That same year his father won election to represent Connecticut in the United States Senate as a member of the Republican Party 43 With support from Mallon and Bush s uncle George Herbert Walker Jr Bush and John Overbey launched the Bush Overbey Oil Development Company in 1951 44 In 1953 he co founded the Zapata Petroleum Corporation an oil company that drilled in the Permian Basin in Texas 45 In 1954 he was named president of the Zapata Offshore Company a subsidiary which specialized in offshore drilling 46 Shortly after the subsidiary became independent in 1959 Bush moved the company and his family from Midland to Houston 47 There he befriended James Baker a prominent attorney who later became an important political ally 48 Bush remained involved with Zapata until the mid 1960s when he sold his stock in the company for approximately $1 million 49 In 1988 The Nation published an article alleging that Bush worked as an operative of the Central Intelligence Agency CIA during the 1960s Bush denied this allegation 50 By the early 1960s Bush was widely regarded as an appealing political candidate and some leading Democrats attempted to convince Bush to become a Democrat He declined to leave the Republican Party later citing his belief that the national Democratic Party favored big centralized government The Democratic Party had historically dominated Texas but Republicans scored their first major victory in the state with John G Tower s victory in a 1961 special election to the United States Senate Motivated by Tower s victory and hoping to prevent the far right John Birch Society from coming to power Bush ran for the chairmanship of the Harris County Republican Party winning election in February 1963 51 Like most other Texas Republicans Bush supported conservative Senator Barry Goldwater over the more centrist Nelson Rockefeller in the 1964 Republican Party presidential primaries 52 In 1964 Bush sought to unseat liberal Democrat Ralph W Yarborough in Texas s U S Senate election 53 Bolstered by superior fundraising Bush won the Republican primary by defeating former gubernatorial nominee Jack Cox in a run off election In the general election Bush attacked Yarborough s vote for the Civil Rights Act of 1964 which banned racial and gender discrimination in public institutions and in many privately owned businesses Bush argued that the act unconstitutionally expanded the powers of the federal government but he was privately uncomfortable with the racial politics of opposing the act 54 He lost the election 56 percent to 44 percent though he did run well ahead of Goldwater the Republican presidential nominee 53 Despite the loss the New York Times reported that Bush was rated by political friend and foe alike as the Republicans best prospect in Texas because of his attractive personal qualities and the strong campaign he put up for the Senate 55 In 1966 Bush ran for the United States House of Representatives in Texas s 7th congressional district a newly redistricted seat in the Greater Houston area Initial polling showed him trailing his Democratic opponent Harris County District Attorney Frank Briscoe but he ultimately won the race with 57 percent of the vote 56 In an effort to woo potential candidates in the South and Southwest House Republicans secured Bush an appointment to the powerful United States House Committee on Ways and Means making Bush the first freshman to serve on the committee since 1904 57 His voting record in the House was generally conservative He supported the Nixon administration s Vietnam policies but broke with Republicans on the issue of birth control which he supported He also voted for the Civil Rights Act of 1968 although it was generally unpopular in his district 58 59 In 1968 Bush joined several other Republicans in issuing the party s Response to the State of the Union address Bush s part of the address focused on a call for fiscal responsibility 60 Though most other Texas Republicans supported Ronald Reagan in the 1968 Republican Party presidential primaries Bush endorsed Richard Nixon who went on to win the party s nomination Nixon considered selecting Bush as his running mate in the 1968 presidential election but he ultimately chose Spiro Agnew instead Bush won re election to the House unopposed while Nixon defeated Hubert Humphrey in the presidential election 61 In 1970 with President Nixon s support Bush gave up his seat in the House to run for the Senate against Yarborough Bush easily won the Republican primary but Yarborough was defeated by the more conservative Lloyd Bentsen in the Democratic primary 62 Ultimately Bentsen defeated Bush taking 53 5 percent of the vote 63 After the 1970 Senate election Bush accepted a position as a senior adviser to the president but he convinced Nixon to instead appoint him as the U S Ambassador to the United Nations 64 The position represented Bush s first foray into foreign policy as well as his first major experiences with the Soviet Union and China the two major U S rivals in the Cold War 65 During Bush s tenure the Nixon administration pursued a policy of détente seeking to ease tensions with both the Soviet Union and China 66 Bush s ambassadorship was marked by a defeat on the China question as the United Nations General Assembly voted to expel the Republic of China and replace it with the People s Republic of China in October 1971 67 In the 1971 crisis in Pakistan Bush supported an Indian motion at the UN General Assembly to condemn the Pakistani government of Yahya Khan for waging genocide in East Pakistan modern Bangladesh referring to the tradition which we have supported that the human rights question transcended domestic jurisdiction and should be freely debated 68 Bush s support for India at the UN put him into conflict with Nixon who was supporting Pakistan partly because Yahya Khan was a useful intermediary in his attempts to reach out to China and partly because the president was fond of Yahya Khan 69 After Nixon won a landslide victory in the 1972 presidential election he appointed Bush as chair of the Republican National Committee RNC 70 71 In that position he was charged with fundraising candidate recruitment and making appearances on behalf of the party in the media When Agnew was being investigated for corruption Bush assisted at the request of Nixon and Agnew in pressuring John Glenn Beall Jr the U S Senator from Maryland to force his brother George Beall the U S Attorney in Maryland who was supervising the investigation into Agnew Attorney Beall ignored the pressure 72 During Bush s tenure at the RNC the Watergate scandal emerged into public view the scandal originated from the June 1972 break in of the Democratic National Committee but also involved later efforts to cover up the break in by Nixon and other members of the White House 73 Bush initially defended Nixon steadfastly but as Nixon s complicity became clear he focused more on defending the Republican Party 58 Following the resignation of Vice President Agnew in 1973 for a scandal unrelated to Watergate Bush was considered for the position of vice president but the appointment instead went to Gerald Ford 74 After the public release of an audio recording that confirmed that Nixon had plotted to use the CIA to cover up the Watergate break in Bush joined other party leaders in urging Nixon to resign 75 When Nixon resigned on August 9 1974 Bush noted in his diary that There was an aura of sadness like somebody died The resignation speech was vintage Nixon—a kick or two at the press—enormous strains One couldn t help but look at the family and the whole thing and think of his accomplishments and then think of the shame President Gerald Ford s swearing in offered indeed a new spirit a new lift 76 Upon his ascension to the presidency Ford strongly considered Bush Donald Rumsfeld and Nelson Rockefeller for the vacant position of vice president Ford ultimately chose Nelson Rockefeller partly because of the publication of a news report claiming that Bush s 1970 campaign had benefited from a secret fund set up by Nixon Bush was later cleared of any suspicion by a special prosecutor 77 Bush accepted appointment as Chief of the U S Liaison Office in the People s Republic of China making him the de facto ambassador to China 78 According to biographer Jon Meacham Bush s time in China convinced him that American engagement abroad was needed to ensure global stability and that the United States needed to be visible but not pushy muscular but not domineering 79 In January 1976 Ford brought Bush back to Washington to become the Director of Central Intelligence DCI placing him in charge of the CIA 80 In the aftermath of the Watergate scandal and the Vietnam War the CIA s reputation had been damaged for its role in various covert operations and Bush was tasked with restoring the agency s morale and public reputation 81 f During Bush s year in charge of the CIA the U S national security apparatus actively supported Operation Condor operations and right wing military dictatorships in Latin America 82 83 Meanwhile Ford decided to drop Rockefeller from the ticket for the 1976 presidential election he considered Bush as his running mate but ultimately chose Bob Dole 84 In his capacity as DCI Bush gave national security briefings to Jimmy Carter both as a presidential candidate and as president elect 85 Bush s tenure at the CIA ended after Carter narrowly defeated Ford in the 1976 presidential election Out of public office for the first time since the 1960s Bush became chairman on the Executive Committee of the First International Bank in Houston 86 He also spent a year as a part time professor of Administrative Science at Rice University s Jones School of Business 87 continued his membership in the Council on Foreign Relations and joined the Trilateral Commission Meanwhile he began to lay the groundwork for his candidacy in the 1980 Republican Party presidential primaries 88 In the 1980 Republican primary campaign Bush faced Ronald Reagan who was widely regarded as the front runner as well as other contenders like Senator Bob Dole Senator Howard Baker Texas Governor John Connally Congressman Phil Crane and Congressman John B Anderson 89 Bush s campaign cast him as a youthful thinking man s candidate who would emulate the pragmatic conservatism of President Eisenhower 90 In the midst of the Soviet–Afghan War which brought an end to a period of détente and the Iran hostage crisis in which 52 Americans were taken hostage the campaign highlighted Bush s foreign policy experience 91 At the outset of the race Bush focused heavily on winning the January 21 Iowa caucuses making 31 visits to the state 92 He won a close victory in Iowa with 31 5% to Reagan s 29 4% After the win Bush stated that his campaign was full of momentum or the Big Mo 93 and Reagan reorganized his campaign 94 Partly in response to the Bush campaign s frequent questioning of Reagan s age Reagan turned 69 in 1980 the Reagan campaign stepped up attacks on Bush painting him as an elitist who was not truly committed to conservatism 95 Prior to the New Hampshire primary Bush and Reagan agreed to a two person debate organized by The Nashua Telegraph but paid for by the Reagan campaign 94 Days before the debate Reagan announced that he would invite four other candidates to the debate Bush who had hoped that the one on one debate would allow him to emerge as the main alternative to Reagan in the primaries refused to debate the other candidates All six candidates took the stage but Bush refused to speak in the presence of the other candidates Ultimately the other four candidates left the stage and the debate continued but Bush s refusal to debate anyone other than Reagan badly damaged his campaign in New Hampshire 96 He ended up decisively losing New Hampshire s primary to Reagan winning just 23 percent of the vote 94 Bush revitalized his campaign with a victory in Massachusetts but lost the next several primaries As Reagan built up a commanding delegate lead Bush refused to end his campaign but the other candidates dropped out of the race 97 Criticizing his more conservative rival s policy proposals Bush famously labeled Reagan s supply side influenced plans for massive tax cuts as voodoo economics 98 Though he favored lower taxes Bush feared that dramatic reductions in taxation would lead to deficits and in turn cause inflation 99 After Reagan clinched a majority of delegates in late May Bush reluctantly dropped out of the race 100 At the 1980 Republican National Convention Reagan made the last minute decision to select Bush as his vice presidential nominee after negotiations with Ford regarding a Reagan Ford ticket collapsed 101 Though Reagan had resented many of the Bush campaign s attacks during the primary campaign and several conservative leaders had actively opposed Bush s nomination Reagan ultimately decided that Bush s popularity with moderate Republicans made him the best and safest pick Bush who had believed his political career might be over following the primaries eagerly accepted the position and threw himself into campaigning for the Reagan Bush ticket 102 The 1980 general election campaign between Reagan and Carter was conducted amid a multitude of domestic concerns and the ongoing Iran hostage crisis and Reagan sought to focus the race on Carter s handling of the economy 103 Though the race was widely regarded as a close contest for most of the campaign Reagan ultimately won over the large majority of undecided voters 104 Reagan took 50 7 percent of the popular vote and 489 of the 538 electoral votes while Carter won 41% of the popular vote and John Anderson running as an independent candidate won 6 6% of the popular vote 105 As vice president Bush generally maintained a low profile recognizing the constitutional limits of the office he avoided decision making or criticizing Reagan in any way This approach helped him earn Reagan s trust easing tensions left over from their earlier rivalry 94 Bush also generally enjoyed a good relationship with Reagan staffers including his close friend Jim Baker who served as Reagan s initial chief of staff 106 His understanding of the vice presidency was heavily influenced by Vice President Walter Mondale who enjoyed a strong relationship with President Carter in part because of his ability to avoid confrontations with senior staff and Cabinet members and by Vice President Nelson Rockefeller s difficult relationship with some members of the White House staff during the Ford administration 107 The Bushes attended a large number of public and ceremonial events in their positions including many state funerals which became a common joke for comedians As the President of the Senate Bush also stayed in contact with members of Congress and kept the president informed on occurrences on Capitol Hill 94 On March 30 1981 while Bush was in Texas Reagan was shot and seriously wounded by John Hinckley Jr Bush immediately flew back to Washington D C when his plane landed his aides advised him to proceed directly to the White House by helicopter in order to show that the government was still functioning 94 Bush rejected the idea as he feared that such a dramatic scene risked giving the impression that he sought to usurp Reagan s powers and prerogatives 108 During Reagan s short period of incapacity Bush presided over Cabinet meetings met with congressional leaders and foreign leaders and briefed reporters but he consistently rejected the possibility of invoking the Twenty fifth Amendment 109 Bush s handling of the attempted assassination and its aftermath made a positive impression on Reagan who recovered and returned to work within two weeks of the shooting From then on the two men would have regular Thursday lunches in the Oval Office 110 Bush was assigned by Reagan to chair two special task forces one on deregulation and one on international drug smuggling Both were popular issues with conservatives and Bush largely a moderate began courting them through his work The deregulation task force reviewed hundreds of rules making specific recommendations on which ones to amend or revise in order to curb the size of the federal government 94 The Reagan administration s deregulation push had a strong impact on broadcasting finance resource extraction and other economic activities and the administration eliminated numerous government positions 111 Bush also oversaw the administration s national security crisis management organization which had traditionally been the responsibility of the National Security Advisor 112 In 1983 Bush toured Western Europe as part of the Reagan administration s ultimately successful efforts to convince skeptical NATO allies to support the deployment of Pershing II missiles 113 Reagan s approval ratings fell after his first year in office but they bounced back when the United States began to emerge from recession in 1983 114 Former Vice President Walter Mondale was nominated by the Democratic Party in the 1984 presidential election Down in the polls Mondale selected Congresswoman Geraldine Ferraro as his running mate in hopes of galvanizing support for his campaign thus making Ferraro the first female major party vice presidential nominee in U S history 115 She and Bush squared off in a single televised vice presidential debate 94 Public opinion polling consistently showed a Reagan lead in the 1984 campaign and Mondale was unable to shake up the race 116 In the end Reagan won re election winning 49 of 50 states and receiving 59% of the popular vote to Mondale s 41% 117 Mikhail Gorbachev came to power in the Soviet Union in 1985 Rejecting the ideologically rigidity of his three elderly sick predecessors Gorbachev insisted on urgently needed economic and political reforms called glasnost openness and perestroika restructuring 118 At the 1987 Washington Summit Gorbachev and Reagan signed the Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces Treaty which committed both signatories to the total abolition of their respective short range and medium range missile stockpiles 119 The treaty marked the beginning of a new era of trade openness and cooperation between the two powers 120 President Reagan and Secretary of State George Shultz took the lead in these negotiations but Bush sat in on many meetings Bush did not agree with many of the Reagan policies but he did tell Gorbachev that he would seek to continue improving relations if he succeeded Reagan 121 122 On July 13 1985 Bush became the first vice president to serve as acting president when Reagan underwent surgery to remove polyps from his colon Bush served as the acting president for approximately eight hours 123 In 1986 the Reagan administration was shaken by a scandal when it was revealed that administration officials had secretly arranged weapon sales to Iran during the Iran–Iraq War The officials had used the proceeds to fund the anti communist Contras in Nicaragua Democrats had passed a law that appropriated funds could not be used to help the Contras Instead the administration used non appropriated funds from the sales 94 When news of affair broke to the media Bush stated that he had been out of the loop and unaware of the diversion of funds 124 Biographer Jon Meacham writes that no evidence was ever produced proving Bush was aware of the diversion to the contras but he criticizes Bush s out of the loop characterization writing that the record is clear that Bush was aware that the United States in contravention of its own stated policy was trading arms for hostages 125 The Iran–Contra scandal as it became known did serious damage to the Reagan presidency raising questions about Reagan s competency 126 Congress established the Tower Commission to investigate the scandal and at Reagan s request a panel of federal judges appointed Lawrence Walsh as a special prosecutor charged with investigating the Iran–Contra scandal 127 The investigations continued after Reagan left office and though Bush was never charged with a crime the Iran–Contra scandal would remain a political liability for him 128 Bush began planning for a presidential run after the 1984 election and he officially entered the 1988 Republican Party presidential primaries in October 1987 94 He put together a campaign led by Reagan staffer Lee Atwater and which also included his son George W Bush and media consultant Roger Ailes 129 Though he had moved to the right during his time as vice president endorsing a Human Life Amendment and repudiating his earlier comments on voodoo economics Bush still faced opposition from many conservatives in the Republican Party 130 His major rivals for the Republican nomination were Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole of Kansas Congressman Jack Kemp of New York and Christian televangelist Pat Robertson 131 Reagan did not publicly endorse any candidate but he privately expressed support for Bush 132 Though considered the early front runner for the nomination Bush came in third in the Iowa caucus behind Dole and Robertson 133 Much as Reagan had done in 1980 Bush reorganized his staff and concentrated on the New Hampshire primary 94 With help from Governor John H Sununu and an effective campaign attacking Dole for raising taxes Bush overcame an initial polling deficit and won New Hampshire with 39 percent of the vote 134 After Bush won South Carolina and 16 of the 17 states holding a primary on Super Tuesday his competitors dropped out of the race 135 Bush occasionally criticized for his lack of eloquence when compared to Reagan delivered a well received speech at the Republican convention Known as the thousand points of light speech it described Bush s vision of America he endorsed the Pledge of Allegiance prayer in schools capital punishment and gun rights 136 Bush also pledged that he would not raise taxes stating Congress will push me to raise taxes and I ll say no and they ll push and I ll say no and they ll push again And all I can say to them is read my lips No new taxes 137 Bush selected little known Senator Dan Quayle of Indiana as his running mate Though Quayle had compiled an unremarkable record in Congress he was popular among many conservatives and the campaign hoped that Quayle s youth would appeal to younger voters 138 Meanwhile the Democratic Party nominated Governor Michael Dukakis who was known for presiding over an economic turnaround in Massachusetts 139 Leading in the general election polls against Bush Dukakis ran an ineffective low risk campaign 140 The Bush campaign attacked Dukakis as an unpatriotic liberal extremist and seized on the Willie Horton case in which a convicted felon from Massachusetts raped a woman while on a prison furlough a program Dukakis supported as governor The Bush campaign charged that Dukakis presided over a revolving door that allowed dangerous convicted felons to leave prison 141 Dukakis damaged his own campaign with a widely mocked ride in an M1 Abrams tank and a poor performance at the second presidential debate 142 Bush also attacked Dukakis for opposing a law that would require all students to recite the Pledge of Allegiance 136 The election is widely considered to have had a high level of negative campaigning though political scientist John Geer has argued that the share of negative ads was in line with previous presidential elections 143 Bush defeated Dukakis by a margin of 426 to 111 in the Electoral College and he took 53 4 percent of the national popular vote 144 Bush ran well in all the major regions of the country but especially in the South 145 He became the first sitting vice president to be elected president since Martin Van Buren in 1836 and the first person to succeed a president from his own party via election since Herbert Hoover in 1929 94 g In the concurrent congressional elections Democrats retained control of both houses of Congress 147 Bush was inaugurated on January 20 1989 succeeding Ronald Reagan In his inaugural address Bush said I come before you and assume the Presidency at a moment rich with promise We live in a peaceful prosperous time but we can make it better For a new breeze is blowing and a world refreshed by freedom seems reborn for in man s heart if not in fact the day of the dictator is over The totalitarian era is passing its old ideas blown away like leaves from an ancient lifeless tree A new breeze is blowing and a nation refreshed by freedom stands ready to push on There is new ground to be broken and new action to be taken 148 Bush s first major appointment was that of James Baker as Secretary of State 149 Leadership of the Department of Defense went to Dick Cheney who had previously served as Gerald Ford s chief of staff and would later serve as vice president under his son George W Bush 150 Jack Kemp joined the administration as Secretary of Housing and Urban Development while Elizabeth Dole the wife of Bob Dole and a former Secretary of Transportation became the Secretary of Labor under Bush 151 Bush retained several Reagan officials including Secretary of the Treasury Nicholas F Brady Attorney General Dick Thornburgh and Secretary of Education Lauro Cavazos 152 New Hampshire Governor John Sununu a strong supporter of Bush during the 1988 campaign became chief of staff 149 Brent Scowcroft was appointed as the National Security Advisor a role he had also held under Ford 153 During the first year of his tenure Bush put a pause on Reagan s détente policy toward the USSR 154 Bush and his advisers were initially divided on Gorbachev some administration officials saw him as a democratic reformer but others suspected him of trying to make the minimum changes necessary to restore the Soviet Union to a competitive position with the United States 155 In 1989 all the Communist governments collapsed in Eastern Europe Gorbachev declined to send in the Soviet military effectively abandoning the Brezhnev Doctrine The U S was not directly involved in these upheavals but the Bush administration avoided gloating over the demise of the Eastern Bloc to avoid undermining further democratic reforms 156 Bush and Gorbachev met at the Malta Summit in December 1989 Though many on the right remained wary of Gorbachev Bush came away with the belief that Gorbachev would negotiate in good faith 157 For the remainder of his term Bush sought cooperative relations with Gorbachev believing that he was the key to peace 158 The primary issue at the Malta Summit was the potential reunification of Germany While Britain and France were wary of a re unified Germany Bush joined West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl in pushing for German reunification 159 Bush believed that a reunified Germany would serve American interests 160 After extensive negotiations Gorbachev agreed to allow a reunified Germany to be a part of NATO and Germany officially reunified in October 1990 after paying billions of marks to Moscow 161 Gorbachev used force to suppress nationalist movements within the Soviet Union itself 162 A crisis in Lithuania left Bush in a difficult position as he needed Gorbachev s cooperation in the reunification of Germany and feared that the collapse of the Soviet Union could leave nuclear arms in dangerous hands The Bush administration mildly protested Gorbachev s suppression of Lithuania s independence movement but took no action to directly intervene 163 Bush warned independence movements of the disorder that could come with secession from the Soviet Union in a 1991 address that critics labeled the Chicken Kiev speech he cautioned against suicidal nationalism 164 In July 1991 Bush and Gorbachev signed the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty START I treaty in which both countries agreed to cut their strategic nuclear weapons by 30 percent 165 In August 1991 hard line Communists launched a coup against Gorbachev while the coup quickly fell apart it broke the remaining power of Gorbachev and the central Soviet government 166 Later that month Gorbachev resigned as general secretary of the Communist party and Russian president Boris Yeltsin ordered the seizure of Soviet property Gorbachev clung to power as the President of the Soviet Union until December 1991 when the Soviet Union dissolved 167 Fifteen states emerged from the Soviet Union and of those states Russia was the largest and most populous Bush and Yeltsin met in February 1992 declaring a new era of friendship and partnership 168 In January 1993 Bush and Yeltsin agreed to START II which provided for further nuclear arms reductions on top of the original START treaty 169 The collapse of the Soviet Union prompted reflections on the future of the world following the end of the Cold War one political scientist Francis Fukuyama speculated that humanity had reached the end of history in that liberal capitalist democracy had permanently triumphed over Communism and fascism 170 Meanwhile the collapse of the Soviet Union and other Communist governments led to post Soviet conflicts in Central Europe Eastern Europe Central Asia and Africa that would continue long after Bush left office 171 During the 1980s the U S had provided aid to Panamanian leader Manuel Noriega an anti Communist dictator who engaged in drug trafficking In May 1989 Noriega annulled the results of a democratic presidential election in which Guillermo Endara had been elected Bush objected to the annulment of the election and worried about the status of the Panama Canal with Noriega still in office 172 Bush dispatched 2 000 soldiers to the country where they began conducting regular military exercises in violation of prior treaties 173 After a U S serviceman was shot by Panamanian forces in December 1989 Bush ordered the United States invasion of Panama known as Operation Just Cause The invasion was the first large scale American military operation in more than 40 years that was not related to the Cold War American forces quickly took control of the Panama Canal Zone and Panama City Noriega surrendered on January 3 1990 and was quickly transported to a prison in the United States Twenty three Americans died in the operation while another 394 were wounded Noriega was convicted and imprisoned on racketeering and drug trafficking charges in April 1992 172 Historian Stewart Brewer argues that the invasion represented a new era in American foreign policy because Bush did not justify the invasion under the Monroe Doctrine or the threat of Communism but rather on the grounds that it was in the best interests of the United States 174 Faced with massive debts and low oil prices in the aftermath of the Iran–Iraq War Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein decided to conquer the country of Kuwait a small oil rich country situated on Iraq s southern border 175 After Iraq invaded Kuwait in August 1990 Bush imposed economic sanctions on Iraq and assembled a multi national coalition opposed to the invasion 176 The administration feared that a failure to respond to the invasion would embolden Hussein to attack Saudi Arabia or Israel and wanted to discourage other countries from similar aggression 177 Bush also wanted to ensure continued access to oil as Iraq and Kuwait collectively accounted for 20 percent of the world s oil production and Saudi Arabia produced another 26 percent of the world s oil supply 178 At Bush s insistence in November 1990 the United Nations Security Council approved a resolution authorizing the use of force if Iraq did not withdrawal from Kuwait by January 15 1991 179 Gorbachev s support as well as China s abstention helped ensure passage of the UN resolution 180 Bush convinced Britain France and other nations to commit soldiers to an operation against Iraq and he won important financial backing from Germany Japan South Korea Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates 181 In January 1991 Bush asked Congress to approve a joint resolution authorizing a war against Iraq 182 Bush believed that the UN resolution had already provided him with the necessary authorization to launch a military operation against Iraq but he wanted to show that the nation was united behind a military action 183 Despite the opposition of a majority of Democrats in both the House and the Senate Congress approved the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution of 1991 182 After the January 15 deadline passed without an Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait U S and coalition forces began a conducted a bombing campaign that devastated Iraq s power grid and communications network and resulted in the desertion of about 100 000 Iraqi soldiers In retaliation Iraq launched Scud missiles at Israel and Saudi Arabia but most of the missiles did little damage On February 23 coalition forces began a ground invasion into Kuwait evicting Iraqi forces by the end of February 27 About 300 Americans as well as approximately 65 soldiers from other coalition nations died during the military action 184 A cease fire was arranged on March 3 and the UN passed a resolution establishing a peacekeeping force in a demilitarized zone between Kuwait and Iraq 185 A March 1991 Gallup poll showed that Bush had an approval rating of 89 percent the highest presidential approval rating in the history of Gallup polling 186 After 1991 the UN maintained economic sanctions against Iraq and the United Nations Special Commission was assigned to ensure that Iraq did not revive its weapons of mass destruction program 187 In 1987 the U S and Canada had reached a free trade agreement that eliminated many tariffs between the two countries President Reagan had intended it as the first step towards a larger trade agreement to eliminate most tariffs among the United States Canada and Mexico 188 The Bush administration along with the Progressive Conservative Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney spearheaded the negotiations of the North American Free Trade Agreement NAFTA with Mexico In addition to lowering tariffs the proposed treaty would affected patents copyrights and trademarks 189 In 1991 Bush sought fast track authority which grants the president the power to submit an international trade agreement to Congress without the possibility of amendment Despite congressional opposition led by House Majority Leader Dick Gephardt both houses of Congress voted to grant Bush fast track authority NAFTA was signed in December 1992 after Bush lost re election 190 but President Clinton won ratification of NAFTA in 1993 191 NAFTA remains controversial for its impact on wages jobs and overall economic growth 192 The U S economy had generally performed well since emerging from recession in late 1982 but it slipped into a mild recession in 1990 The unemployment rate rose from 5 9 percent in 1989 to a high of 7 8 percent in mid 1991 193 194 Large federal deficits spawned during the Reagan years rose from $152 1 billion in 1989 195 to $220 billion for 1990 196 the $220 billion deficit represented a threefold increase since 1980 197 As the public became increasingly concerned about the economy and other domestic affairs Bush s well received handling of foreign affairs became less of an issue for most voters 198 Bush s top domestic priority was to bring an end to federal budget deficits which he saw as a liability for the country s long term economic health and standing in the world 199 As he was opposed to major defense spending cuts 200 and had pledged to not raise taxes the president had major difficulties in balancing the budget 201 Bush and congressional leaders agreed to avoid major changes to the budget for fiscal year 1990 which began in October 1989 However both sides knew that spending cuts or new taxes would be necessary in the following year s budget in order to avoid the draconian automatic domestic spending cuts required by the Gramm–Rudman–Hollings Balanced Budget Act of 1987 202 Bush and other leaders also wanted to cut deficits because Federal Reserve Chair Alan Greenspan refused to lower interest rates and thus stimulate economic growth unless the federal budget deficit was reduced 203 In a statement released in late June 1990 Bush said that he would be open to a deficit reduction program which included spending cuts incentives for economic growth budget process reform as well as tax increases 204 To fiscal conservatives in the Republican Party Bush s statement represented a betrayal and they heavily criticized him for compromising so early in the negotiations 205 In September 1990 Bush and Congressional Democrats announced a compromise to cut funding for mandatory and discretionary programs while also raising revenue partly through a higher gas tax The compromise additionally included a pay as you go provision that required that new programs be paid for at the time of implementation 206 House Minority Whip Newt Gingrich led the conservative opposition to the bill strongly opposing any form of tax increase 207 Some liberals also criticized the budget cuts in the compromise and in October the House rejected the deal resulting in a brief government shutdown Without the strong backing of the Republican Party Bush agreed to another compromise bill this one more favorable to Democrats The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 OBRA 90 enacted on October 27 1990 dropped much of the gasoline tax increase in favor of higher income taxes on top earners It included cuts to domestic spending but the cuts were not as deep as those that had been proposed in the original compromise Bush s decision to sign the bill damaged his standing with conservatives and the general public but it also laid the groundwork for the budget surpluses of the late 1990s 208 Bush s remarks at the signing ceremony for the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 209 The disabled had not received legal protections under the landmark Civil Rights Act of 1964 and many faced discrimination and segregation by the time Bush took office In 1988 Lowell P Weicker Jr and Tony Coelho had introduced the Americans with Disabilities Act which barred employment discrimination against qualified individuals with disabilities The bill had passed the Senate but not the House and it was reintroduced in 1989 Though some conservatives opposed the bill due to its costs and potential burdens on businesses Bush strongly supported it partly because his son Neil had struggled with dyslexia After the bill passed both houses of Congress Bush signed the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 into law in July 1990 210 The act required employers and public accommodations to make reasonable accommodations for the disabled while providing an exception when such accommodations imposed an undue hardship 211 Senator Ted Kennedy later led the congressional passage of a separate civil rights bill designed to facilitate launching employment discrimination lawsuits 212 In vetoing the bill Bush argued that it would lead to racial quotas in hiring 213 214 In November 1991 Bush signed the Civil Rights Act of 1991 which was largely similar to the bill he had vetoed in the previous year 212 In August 1990 Bush signed the Ryan White CARE Act the largest federally funded program dedicated to assisting persons living with HIV AIDS 215 Throughout his presidency the AIDS epidemic grew dramatically in the U S and around the world and Bush often found himself at odds with AIDS activist groups who criticized him for not placing a high priority on HIV AIDS research and funding Frustrated by the administration s lack of urgency on the issue ACT UP dumped the ashes of HIV AIDS victims on the White House lawn during a viewing of the AIDS Quilt in 1992 216 By that time HIV had become the leading cause of death in the U S for men aged 25–44 217 In June 1989 the Bush administration proposed a bill to amend the Clean Air Act Working with Senate Majority Leader George J Mitchell the administration won passage of the amendments over the opposition of business aligned members of Congress who feared the impact of tougher regulations 218 The legislation sought to curb acid rain and smog by requiring decreased emissions of chemicals such as sulfur dioxide 219 and was the first major update to the Clean Air Act since 1977 220 Bush also signed the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 in response to the Exxon Valdez oil spill However the League of Conservation Voters criticized some of Bush s other environmental actions including his opposition to stricter auto mileage standards 221 President Bush devoted attention to voluntary service as a means of solving some of America s most serious social problems He often used the thousand points of light theme to describe the power of citizens to solve community problems In his 1989 inaugural address President Bush said I have spoken of a thousand points of light of all the community organizations that are spread like stars throughout the Nation doing good 222 During his presidency Bush honored numerous volunteers with the Daily Point of Light Award a tradition that was continued by his presidential successors 223 In 1990 the Points of Light Foundation was created as a nonprofit organization in Washington to promote this spirit of volunteerism 224 In 2007 the Points of Light Foundation merged with the Hands On Network to create a new organization Points of Light 225 Bush appointed two justices to the Supreme Court of the United States In 1990 Bush appointed a largely unknown state appellate judge David Souter to replace liberal icon William Brennan 226 Souter was easily confirmed and served until 2009 but joined the liberal bloc of the court disappointing Bush 226 In 1991 Bush nominated conservative federal judge Clarence Thomas to succeed Thurgood Marshall a long time liberal stalwart Thomas the former head of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission EEOC faced heavy opposition in the Senate as well as from pro choice groups and the NAACP His nomination faced another difficulty when Anita Hill accused Thomas of having sexually harassed her during his time as the chair of EEOC Thomas won confirmation in a narrow 52–48 vote 43 Republicans and 9 Democrats voted to confirm Thomas s nomination while 46 Democrats and 2 Republicans voted against confirmation 227 Thomas became one of the most conservative justices of his era 228 Bush s education platform consisted mainly of offering federal support for a variety of innovations such as open enrollment incentive pay for outstanding teachers and rewards for schools that improve performance with underprivileged children 229 Though Bush did not pass a major educational reform package during his presidency his ideas influenced later reform efforts including Goals 2000 and the No Child Left Behind Act 230 Bush signed the Immigration Act of 1990 231 which led to a 40 percent increase in legal immigration to the United States 232 The act more than doubled the number of visas given to immigrants on the basis of job skills 233 In the wake of the savings and loan crisis Bush proposed a $50 billion package to rescue the savings and loans industry and also proposed the creation of the Office of Thrift Supervision to regulate the industry Congress passed the Financial Institutions Reform Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 which incorporated most of Bush s proposals 234 Bush was widely seen as a pragmatic caretaker president who lacked a unified and compelling long term theme in his efforts 235 236 237 Indeed Bush s sound bite where he refers to the issue of overarching purpose as the vision thing has become a metonym applied to other political figures accused of similar difficulties 238 239 240 241 242 243 His ability to gain broad international support for the Gulf War and the war s result were seen as both a diplomatic and military triumph 244 rousing bipartisan approval 245 though his decision to withdraw without removing Saddam Hussein left mixed feelings and attention returned to the domestic front and a souring economy 246 A New York Times article mistakenly depicted Bush as being surprised to see a supermarket barcode reader 247 248 the report of his reaction exacerbated the notion that he was out of touch 247 Amid the early 1990s recession his image shifted from conquering hero to politician befuddled by economic matters 249 At the elite level a number of commentators and political experts deplored the state of American politics in 1991–1992 and reported the voters were angry Many analysts blamed the poor quality of national election campaigns 250 Bush announced his reelection bid in early 1992 with a coalition victory in the Persian Gulf War and high approval ratings Bush s reelection initially looked likely 251 As a result many leading Democrats including Mario Cuomo Dick Gephardt and Al Gore declined to seek their party s presidential nomination 252 However Bush s tax increase had angered many conservatives who believed that Bush had strayed from the conservative principles of Ronald Reagan 253 He faced a challenge from conservative political columnist Pat Buchanan in the 1992 Republican primaries 254 Bush fended off Buchanan s challenge and won his party s nomination at the 1992 Republican National Convention but the convention adopted a socially conservative platform strongly influenced by the Christian right 255 Meanwhile the Democrats nominated Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas A moderate who was affiliated with the Democratic Leadership Council DLC Clinton favored welfare reform deficit reduction and a tax cut for the middle class 256 In early 1992 the race took an unexpected twist when Texas billionaire H Ross Perot launched a third party bid claiming that neither Republicans nor Democrats could eliminate the deficit and make government more efficient His message appealed to voters across the political spectrum disappointed with both parties perceived fiscal irresponsibility 257 Perot also attacked NAFTA which he claimed would lead to major job losses 258 National polling taken in mid 1992 showed Perot in the lead but Clinton experienced a surge through effective campaigning and the selection of Senator Al Gore a popular and relatively young Southerner as his running mate 259 Clinton won the election taking 43 percent of the popular vote and 370 electoral votes while Bush won 37 5 percent of the popular vote and 168 electoral votes 260 Perot won 19% of the popular vote one of the highest totals for a third party candidate in U S history drawing equally from both major candidates according to exit polls 261 Clinton performed well in the Northeast the Midwest and the West Coast while also waging the strongest Democratic campaign in the South since the 1976 election 262 Several factors were important in Bush s defeat The ailing economy which arose from recession may have been the main factor in Bush s loss as 7 in 10 voters said on election day that the economy was either not so good or poor 263 264 On the eve of the 1992 election the unemployment rate stood at 7 8% which was the highest it had been since 1984 265 The president was also damaged by his alienation of many conservatives in his party 266 Bush blamed Perot in part for his defeat though exit polls showed that Perot drew his voters about equally from Clinton and Bush 267 Despite his defeat Bush left office with a 56 percent job approval rating in January 1993 268 Like many of his predecessors Bush issued a series of pardons during his last days in office In December 1992 he granted executive clemency to six former senior government officials implicated in the Iran Contra scandal most prominently former Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger 269 The charges against the six were that they lied to or withheld information from Congress The pardons effectively brought an end to the Iran Contra scandal 270 According to Seymour Martin Lipset the 1992 election had several unique characteristics Voters felt that economic conditions were worse than they actually were which harmed Bush A rare event was the a strong third party candidate Liberals launched a backlash against 12 years of a conservative White House The chief factor was Clinton s uniting his party and winning over a number of heterogeneous groups 271 After leaving office Bush and his wife built a retirement house in the community of West Oaks Houston 272 He established a presidential office within the Park Laureate Building on Memorial Drive in Houston 273 He also frequently spent time at his vacation home in Kennebunkport took annual cruises in Greece went on fishing trips in Florida and visited the Bohemian Club in Northern California He declined to serve on corporate boards but delivered numerous paid speeches and served as an adviser to The Carlyle Group a private equity firm 274 He never published his memoirs but he and Brent Scowcroft co wrote A World Transformed a 1999 work on foreign policy Portions of his letters and his diary were later published as The China Diary of George H W Bush and All The Best George Bush 275 During a 1993 visit to Kuwait Bush was targeted in an assassination plot directed by the Iraqi Intelligence Service President Clinton retaliated when he ordered the firing of 23 cruise missiles at Iraqi Intelligence Service headquarters in Baghdad 276 Bush did not publicly comment on the assassination attempt or the missile strike but privately spoke with Clinton shortly before the strike took place 277 In the 1994 gubernatorial elections his sons George W and Jeb concurrently ran for Governor of Texas and Governor of Florida Concerning their political careers he advised them both that a t some point both of you may want to say Well I don t agree with my Dad on that point or Frankly I think Dad was wrong on that Do it Chart your own course not just on the issues but on defining yourselves 278 George W won his race against Ann Richards while Jeb lost to Lawton Chiles After the results came in the elder Bush told ABC I have very mixed emotions Proud father is the way I would sum it all up 279 Jeb would again run for governor of Florida in 1998 and win at the same time that his brother George W won re election in Texas It marked the second time in United States history that a pair of brothers served simultaneously as governors 280 Bush supported his son s candidacy in the 2000 presidential election but did not actively campaign in the election and did not deliver a speech at the 2000 Republican National Convention 281 George W Bush defeated Al Gore in the 2000 election and was re elected in 2004 Bush and his son thus became the second father–son pair to each serve as President of the United States following John Adams and John Quincy Adams 282 Through previous administrations the elder Bush had ubiquitously been known as George Bush or President Bush but following his son s election the need to distinguish between them has made retronymic forms such as George H W Bush and George Bush Sr and colloquialisms such as Bush 41 and Bush the Elder more common 283 Bush advised his son on some personnel choices approving of the selection of Dick Cheney as running mate and the retention of George Tenet as CIA Director However he was not consulted on all appointments including that of his old rival Donald Rumsfeld as Secretary of Defense 284 Though he avoided giving unsolicited advice to his son Bush and his son also discussed some matters of policy especially regarding national security issues 285 In his retirement Bush generally avoided publicly expressing his opinion on political issues instead using the public spotlight to support various charities 286 Despite earlier political differences with Bill Clinton the two former presidents eventually became friends 287 They appeared together in television ads encouraging aid for victims of Hurricane Katrina and the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami 288 Bush supported Republican John McCain in the 2008 presidential election 289 and Republican Mitt Romney in the 2012 presidential election 290 but both were defeated by Democrat Barack Obama In 2011 Obama awarded Bush with the Presidential Medal of Freedom the highest civilian honor in the United States 291 Bush supported his son Jeb s bid in the 2016 Republican primaries 292 Jeb Bush s campaign struggled however and he withdrew from the race during the primaries Neither George H W nor George W Bush endorsed the eventual Republican nominee Donald Trump 293 all three Bushes emerged as frequent critics of Trump s policies and speaking style while Trump frequently criticized George W Bush s presidency George H W Bush later said that he voted for the Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in the general election 294 After the election Bush wrote a letter to president elect Donald Trump in January 2017 to inform him that because of his poor health he would not be able to attend Trump s inauguration on January 20 he gave him his best wishes 295 In August 2017 after the violence at Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville both Presidents Bush released a joint statement saying America must always reject racial bigotry anti Semitism and hatred in all forms As we pray for Charlottesville we are all reminded of the fundamental truths recorded by that city s most prominent citizen in the Declaration of Independence we are all created equal and endowed by our Creator with unalienable rights 296 297 On April 17 2018 Barbara Bush died at the age of 92 298 at her home in Houston Texas Her funeral was held at St Martin s Episcopal Church in Houston four days later 299 300 Bush along with former Presidents Barack Obama George W Bush son Bill Clinton and fellow First Ladies Melania Trump Michelle Obama Laura Bush daughter in law and Hillary Clinton were representatives who attended the funeral and who took a photo together after the service as a sign of unity which went viral online 301 302 On November 1 Bush went to the polls to vote early in the midterm elections This would be his final public appearance 303 After a long battle with vascular Parkinson s disease Bush died at his home in Houston on November 30 2018 at the age of 94 304 305 At the time of his death he was the longest lived U S president 306 a distinction now held by Jimmy Carter 307 He was also the third oldest vice president h Bush lay in state in the Rotunda of the U S Capitol from December 3 through December 5 he was the 12th U S president to be accorded this honor 309 310 Then on December 5 Bush s casket was transferred from the Capitol rotunda to Washington National Cathedral where a state funeral was held 311 After the funeral Bush s body was transported to George H W Bush Presidential Library in College Station Texas where he was buried next to his wife Barbara and daughter Robin 312 At the funeral former president George W Bush eulogized his father saying He looked for the good in each person and he usually found it 311 In 1991 The New York Times revealed that Bush was suffering from Graves disease a non contagious thyroid condition that his wife Barbara also suffered from 313 Later in life Bush suffered from vascular parkinsonism a form of Parkinson s disease which forced him to use a motorized scooter or wheelchair 314 Bush was a lifelong Episcopalian 315 He cited various moments in his life deepening of his faith including his escape from Japanese forces in 1944 and the death of his three year old daughter Robin in 1953 316 His faith was reflected in his Thousand Points of Light speech his support for prayer in schools and his support for the pro life movement following his election as vice president 315 316 Polls of historians and political scientists have ranked Bush in the top half of presidents A 2018 poll of the American Political Science Association s Presidents and Executive Politics section ranked Bush as the 17th best president out of 44 317 A 2017 C Span poll of historians also ranked Bush as the 20th best president out of 43 318 Richard Rose described Bush as a guardian president and many other historians and political scientists have similarly described Bush as a passive hands off president who was largely content with things as they were 319 Professor Steven Knott writes that g enerally the Bush presidency is viewed as successful in foreign affairs but a disappointment in domestic affairs 320 Biographer Jon Meacham writes that after he left office many Americans viewed Bush as a gracious and underappreciated man who had many virtues but who had failed to project enough of a distinctive identity and vision to overcome the economic challenges of 1991–92 and to win a second term 321 Bush himself noted that his legacy was lost between the glory of Reagan and the trials and tribulations of my sons 322 In the 2010s Bush was fondly remembered for his willingness to compromise which contrasted with the intensely partisan era that followed his presidency 323 In 2018 Vox highlighted Bush for his pragmatism as a moderate Republican president by working across the aisle 324 They specifically noted Bush s accomplishments within the domestic policy by making bipartisan deals including raising with tax budget among the wealthy with the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 Bush also helped pass the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 which The New York Times described as the most sweeping anti discrimination law since the Civil Rights Act of 1964 325 In response to the Exxon Valdez oil spill Bush built another bipartisan coalition to strengthen the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 326 327 Bush also championed and signed into a law the Immigration Act of 1990 a sweeping bipartisan immigration reform act that made it easier for immigrants to legally enter the county while also granting immigrants fleeing violence the temporary protected status visa as well as lifted the pre naturalization English testing process and finally eliminated the exclusion of homosexuals under what Congress now deemed the medically unsound classification of sexual deviant that was included in the 1965 act 328 329 Bush stated Immigration is not just a link to our past but its also a bridge to America s future 330 According to USA Today the legacy of Bush s presidency was defined by his victory over Iraq after the invasion of Kuwait and for his presiding over the Dissolution of the Soviet Union and the German reunification 331 Michael Beschloss and Strobe Talbott praise Bush s handling of the USSR especially how he prodded Gorbachev in terms of releasing control over the satellite states and permitting German unification—and especially a united Germany in NATO 332 Andrew Bacevich judges the Bush administration as morally obtuse in the light of its business as usual attitude towards China after the massacre in Tiananmen Square and its uncritical support of Gorbachev as the Soviet Union disintegrated 333 David Rothkopf argues In 1990 Time magazine named him the Man of the Year 335 In 1997 the Houston Intercontinental Airport was renamed as the George Bush Intercontinental Airport 336 In 1999 the CIA headquarters in Langley Virginia was named the George Bush Center for Intelligence in his honor 337 In 2011 Bush an avid golfer was inducted in the World Golf Hall of Fame 338 The USS George H W Bush CVN 77 the tenth and last Nimitz class supercarrier of the United States Navy was named for Bush 339 340 Bush is commemorated on a postage stamp that was issued by the United States Postal Service in 2019 341 The George H W Bush Presidential Library and Museum the tenth U S presidential library was completed in 1997 342 It contains the presidential and vice presidential papers of Bush and the vice presidential papers of Dan Quayle 343 The library is located on a 90 acre 36 ha site on the west

limited field tournament officially termed an alternate event by the PGA Tour It later became part of the Fall Series a group of events held after The Tour Championship before returning to its former status as an alternate event in 2011 In either case the leading players in men s professional golf rarely participate Until 1994 it was played opposite the Masters Tournament and then opposite The

involving PGA Tour players namely the Ryder Cup and Presidents Cup In 2011 it returned to the PGA Tour regular season opposite the British Open in July It has been an official money event on the PGA Tour since 1994 Prior to that it was a satellite event with the money counting but the wins counting as unofficial From 2007 to 2010 it was part of the Fall Series Because the FedEx Cup season championship was already determined by that time elite players generally passed on Fall Series events most players in the tournament were trying to either make the Top 125 on the money list and retain their tour cards or earn a quick two year exemption by winning The 2007 event was played in the same week as the Presidents Cup most of the top Tour players played in that event instead of the Viking Classic The situation was similar in 2008 with the tournament being scheduled opposite the Ryder Cup The 2009 purse was due to be $3 700 000 with $666 000 going to the winner That year s event was also to be the first in the tournament s recent history to be the sole event on the PGA Tour schedule for that week as it had been moved to the end of October with a scheduled finish on November 1

would be the tournament s last fall edition as it would move into the regular season the following year In 2013 the title sponsor changed to Sanderson Farms 2 The tournament was not held in the 2013–14 season because of the new PGA Tour wraparound season the 2014 tournament part of the 2014–15 season moved to late October and was played opposite the WGC HSBC Champions in China 3 As an alternate event the winner did not receive an invitation to the Masters Tournament but did earn a trip to the PGA Championship a two year PGA Tour exemption a minimum of 24 OWGR points and 300 FedEx Cup points For the 2019–20 season the tournament was significantly upgraded The 2019 tournament will not be an alternate event but a stand alone event in September the second tournament of the season

increase from 2018 with the winner getting $1 188 000 4 Over the years the Sanderson Farms Championship has been played opposite a number of different tournaments Three men have won this tournament

at the Quicken Loans National tournament when he was accused of cheating by his playing partner Joel Dahmen On the dogleg left 566 yard par 5 10th hole Kang s second shot landed in the hazard left of the green After a short search a spotter located Kang s ball some 5 to 8 yards into the hazard There was no way Kang could play the ball Instead he began pointing to the spot at which he thought it had entered the hazard nearly pin high Because the 10th hole is a dogleg left with a hazard all the way down the left side Kang s ball would have needed to re cross the hazard nearer the green in order to earn the drop he was requesting The exact line his ball had taken en route to its final resting place thus came under careful scrutiny There was a discussion with a rules official Dahmen and Kang which reached an impasse as another group played through After further discussion Kang conceded that his ball more likely crossed the hazard 35 yards from the pin rather than his first suggestion Kang dropped the ball at a point 37 yards from the hole hit his approach to 17 feet and holed the putt for a par Later that night Dahmen accused Kang of cheating on Twitter The PGA Tour released a statement indicating that they regarded the issue as closed With no clear evidence to prove otherwise it was determined by the official that Kang could proceed with his fourth shot as intended following a penalty stroke and subsequent drop The PGA Tour will have no additional comment on this matter 4 Kang finished third in the event his best result of the season and earned a place in the

Championship in 2009 but lost in a four hole playoff With a chance to win the tournament with par on the 72nd hole he missed an 8 foot 2 4 m putt then lost to Stewart Cink in the playoff Several of Watson s major victories came at the expense of Jack Nicklaus the man he replaced as number one most notably the 1977 Masters 1977 Open Championship and the 1982 U S Open Though his rivalry with Nicklaus was intense their friendly competitiveness served to increase golf s popularity during the time In Watson s illustrious career his eight major championships include five Open Championships 3 two Masters titles and one U S Open title The only major that has eluded him is the PGA Championship if he had won it would have put him in an elite group of golfing career grand slam winners that includes Gene Sarazen Ben Hogan Gary Player Jack Nicklaus and Tiger Woods In all Watson s eight majors ranks sixth on the list of total major championship victories behind only Nicklaus Woods Walter Hagen Hogan and Player Watson is also regarded as one of the greatest links players of all time a claim backed up by his five Open Championship victories his runner up finishes at the 1984 Open Championship and 2009 Open Championship and his three Senior British Open Championship titles in his mid 50s 2003 2005 and 2007 Watson played on four Ryder Cup teams and captained the American side to

to the game by his father Ray His early coach was Stan Thirsk at the Kansas City Country Club Watson first gained local renown while on his high school team at The Pembroke Country Day School in Kansas City Watson won four Missouri State Amateur championships 1967 1968 1970 and 1971 5 He attended Stanford University playing on the golf and table tennis teams joining Alpha Sigma Phi and graduating with a degree in psychology in 1971 Today he has a home in Overland Park Kansas after fighting a prominent legal battle to prevent annexation by the city 1 Although he voted for George McGovern in his first presidential election Watson later became a Republican 6 He has donated to the National Rifle Association 7 Watson was a member of Kansas City Country Club from the beginning of his professional career However in 1990 he was unsettled by the idea that the leaders of the club rejected an applicant due to his Jewish faith 8 Watson whose wife at the time and two children were Jewish stated It was a very personal decision I just didn t feel my family was welcome It was time to say Hey let s be fair to people Let s not judge people on the basis of race or faith 6 Watson abruptly resigned in 1990 8 However the Jewish applicant H R Block founder Henry W Bloch was ultimately admitted to the club as were other minorities Disarmed by these overtures Watson rejoined the club 6 Watson joined the PGA Tour in 1971 He hired Bruce Edwards to be his caddie for the first time at the 1973 St Louis tournament held at Norwood Hills Country Club and the two connected with Edwards caddying for Watson at most events after that for a period of many years 9 Watson contended in a major championship for the first time at the U S Open in 1974 at Winged Foot but he faded badly in the final round after having the 54 hole lead Following this disappointment Watson was approached in the locker room by legendary retired player Byron Nelson a broadcaster at the event who offered encouragement insight and assistance Nelson and Watson spoke briefly at that time with Nelson saying he liked Watson s game and aggressiveness and offered to help him improve Watson although disappointed by his weak finish was flattered to receive Nelson s interest However the two men did not manage to get together to work on golf in depth until several months later when Watson played in the Tour s Byron Nelson Classic in the Dallas area and visited Nelson s nearby home The two men would eventually develop a close and productive teacher student relationship and friendship Nelson had similarly mentored the young rising star Ken Venturi during the 1950s 10 11 Only two weeks after the Winged Foot collapse in 1974 Watson won his first Tour title at the Western Open near Chicago coming from six shots back in the final round at Butler National 12 13 With Nelson s guidance on swing mechanics and course management and determined hard work Watson s game advanced quickly and he won his first major championship the 1975 Open Championship on his first appearance in the event in Britain Watson holed a 20 foot putt for a birdie on the 72nd hole to tie Jack Newton The following day Watson won an 18 hole playoff at Carnoustie by a stroke carding a 71 to Newton s 72 Watson was able to gain the upper hand in the playoff after chipping in for an eagle at the 14th hole 14 Watson is one of only four players since World War II to have won the Open Championship on their debut the others being Ben Hogan 1953 Tony Lema 1964 and Ben Curtis 2003 15 Watson won his second major championship and his first green jacket as Masters champion in 1977 after a duel with Jack Nicklaus During the final round Watson stood on the 17th green tied with Nicklaus for the lead Watson holed a 20 foot putt for a birdie to go one stroke ahead of Nicklaus Watson s par on the 18th hole won him the Masters title by two strokes after Nicklaus had a bogey on the 18th Watson s 1977 Open Championship victory at Turnberry in Scotland was especially memorable and is considered by many to be the finest tournament played in the second half of the 20th century After two rounds he and Jack Nicklaus were one shot out of the lead and paired for the third round Both shot 65 ending the third round three shots clear of the field Watson and Nicklaus were again paired for the final round On the last day the two were tied after 16 holes Nicklaus missed a makeable birdie putt on 17 losing his share of the lead to Watson who birdied 17 On the 18th Nicklaus drove into the rough while Watson drove the fairway Watson s approach landed two feet from the flag while Nicklaus after a drive into deep rough and near a gorse plant managed to get his approach 40 feet away Nicklaus sank his birdie putt to finish with a 66 but Watson followed suit with his own birdie finishing with a second straight 65 and his second Open with a record score of 268 12 under par The two players finished well ahead of the other challengers Hubert Green in third place was ten strokes behind Nicklaus at 279 and shot the same score every round except for the final day which was then played on Saturday In 1978 as defending Masters champion Watson needed a par on the 18th hole of his final round to tie over 72 holes with Gary Player who had shot a record tying final round of 64 However Watson missed out on a playoff by sending his approach shot to the 18th into the gallery and missing the 10 foot par putt he needed for a playoff He finished tied for 2nd place at Augusta one stroke behind Gary Player 16 Watson had five PGA Tour victories in 1978 but he also had one of the biggest disappointments of his career in that year s PGA Championship in August at Oakmont Watson had a five shot lead after 54 holes but lost the tournament in a 3 way sudden death playoff to John Mahaffey This would be the closest that Watson came to landing the one major title that eluded him 17 In 1979 Watson had a further five PGA Tour victories including a five shot victory in the Sea Pines Heritage Classic which he won with a then tournament record 14 under par 270 18 Watson again finished runner up at the Masters in 1979 when he lost in a 3 way sudden death playoff to Fuzzy Zoeller This was the first sudden death playoff at the Masters with the previous playoff at Augusta in 1970 having taken place on Monday under an 18 hole format Watson also finished 2nd in The Players Championship in 1979 Watson had an outstanding year in 1980 A brilliant third round of 64 at Muirfield helped him to win his third Open Championship title in Britain by four strokes He was the leading money winner on the PGA Tour for the fourth consecutive year winning six tournaments in America Watson showed tremendous consistency in 1980 with sixteen top 10 finishes on the PGA Tour that year 19 In August 1980 after his sixth victory of the year in America Watson said I love this game I feel that dedication is the only way to improve I ve been more consistent this year than in the previous three years 20 In 1981 Watson won his second Masters title at Augusta by two strokes over Jack Nicklaus and Johnny Miller Watson had a further two Tour victories in 1981 at the USF G New Orleans Open and the Atlanta Classic The U S Open was the major that Watson most wanted to win In 1982 at Pebble Beach he was able to realize his dream after an engaging duel with Jack Nicklaus in one of the most memorable major championships of all time Playing three groups ahead of Watson in the final round Nicklaus charged into a share of the lead with five consecutive birdies When Watson reached the par 3 17th hole the two were still tied but with Nicklaus safely in the clubhouse at 4 under par 284 Watson hit his tee shot on the 17th into the rough just off the green leaving an extremely difficult chip shot downhill on a very fast green While being interviewed on national television and fully aware of Watson s perilous predicament Nicklaus appeared confident he was on his way to an unprecedented fifth U S Open championship Watson s chip shot amazingly hit the flag stick and fell into the cup giving him a miraculous birdie and setting the stage for yet another win over Nicklaus Watson went on to birdie the 18th as well for a final margin of two shots The following month in July 1982 at Royal Troon in Scotland Watson became only the third golfer since World War II to win the U S Open and Open Championship in the same year after Ben Hogan 1953 and Lee Trevino 1971 a feat later matched by Tiger Woods 2000 21 After the first two rounds of the 1982 Open Championship Watson was seven shots behind the leader Bobby Clampett whose commanding lead was reduced after a third round of 78 During the final round Nick Price who was playing in one of the groups behind Watson gained the lead Watson stood on the 18th tee of the final round two strokes behind Price Watson waited patiently after his round as Price s lead evaporated leaving Watson the Open winner by one stroke 22 In 1983 as defending U S Open champion at Oakmont Watson shared the 54 hole lead with Seve Ballesteros In the final round though Watson missed a 6 foot putt for par on the 17th and finished in 2nd place one stroke behind the winner Larry Nelson 23 The following month in July 1983 Watson won his fifth Open Championship and the last of his eight majors at Royal Birkdale his only Open victory on English soil His four other titles came in Scotland 24 In 1984 Watson finished runner up for the third time at the Masters finishing two strokes behind the champion Ben Crenshaw Watson had three Tour wins in 1984 including his third victory in the Western Open after a playoff against Greg Norman A fortnight later in the 1984 Open Championship at St Andrews Watson was in contention during the final holes to win a third consecutive Open and a sixth Open Championship overall to tie the record for the most Open wins by Harry Vardon However Watson bogeyed the par 4 Road Hole 17th and Seve Ballesteros birdied the 18th resulting in a victory for Ballesteros and Watson finishing in a tie for 2nd place 25 After his runner up finish in the 1984 British Open Watson did not manage to win a PGA Tour event for the next three years until the 1987 Nabisco Championship Watson went from being the PGA Tour money leader in 1984 26 to finishing 18th on the PGA Tour s money list in 1985 26 As a result of a decline in form Watson missed out on a place in the 1985 U S Ryder Cup team In the 1986 Hawaiian Open Watson was the third round leader and was aiming to end his winless streak since July 1984 However Watson bogeyed the 71st and 72nd holes and finished in a tie for 3rd place behind the winner Corey Pavin 27 In the 1987 U S Open Watson had a one shot lead going into the final round at the Olympic Club Watson was a gallery favorite during the tournament He had strong support from the spectators having played golf for Stanford University 30 miles south of the Olympic Club in San Francisco 28 He was aiming to win his ninth major championship which would have tied him for major wins with Ben Hogan and Gary Player but Watson lost the tournament by a stroke to Scott Simpson In the final round Simpson had three consecutive birdies on the back nine to take the lead Watson s 45 foot putt for a birdie on the 72nd hole which would have forced a playoff with Simpson was about two inches short 29 Watson s stellar play on the PGA Tour faded in the late 1980s when he began to have problems putting even though his tee to green game seemed to improve During this period he had some near misses in tournaments Watson finished 2nd at the 1988 NEC World Series of Golf missing a 3 foot putt in a playoff against Mike Reid 30 In 1989 Watson was in contention during the Open Championship at Royal Troon but he finished in 4th place two strokes outside the playoff between Mark Calcavecchia Wayne Grady and Greg Norman At the 1991 Masters Tournament Watson stood on the 18th tee in the final round at Augusta with a share of the lead but had a double bogey 6 to finish in a tie for 3rd place two strokes behind the champion Ian Woosnam 31 It was Watson s 15th consecutive top 20 finish at The Masters having finished in the top 10 of The Masters in 13 of the 15 years between 1977 and 1991 In 1994 when The Open Championship returned to Turnberry the site of his 1977 victory Watson commented Sometimes you lose your desire through the years Any golfer goes through that When you play golf for a living like anything in your life you are never going to be constantly at the top 32 He finished tied for 11th at the Open Championship that year but he had a revival in the late 1990s winning the 1996 Memorial Tournament and gaining the last of his 39 wins on the PGA Tour at the 1998 MasterCard Colonial when he was 48 years old In 1997 Watson won the Japan Golf Tour s prestigious Dunlop Phoenix tournament for the second time It was the last of his four victories in Japan In the 2003 U S Open at age 53 he shared the opening round lead by shooting a 65 with his long time caddy Bruce Edwards carrying his clubs and giving advice Edwards had been diagnosed with Lou Gehrig s disease earlier in the year and Watson contributed significant time and money that year with Bruce to raise money for research into finding a cure for motor neuron disease Edwards died on April 8 2004 Watson was one of two players to play with Jack Nicklaus in the final two rounds of golf in Nicklaus career which ended at the 2005 Open Championship on the Old Course at St Andrews Englishman Luke Donald was the third member of the group In the first round of the 2009 Open Championship at Turnberry Watson shot a 5 under 65 one stroke behind the leader Miguel Ángel Jiménez 33 In the second round he tied for the lead after making a huge putt on the 18th green His score for the round was 70 38 out and 32 back This made Watson – at 59 years of age – the oldest man to have the lead after any round of a major In addition with a relatively low scoring third round one over par 71 he kept the lead outright by one shot so also became the oldest player to lead a major going into the last round He acknowledged after that 3rd round he was thinking of Bruce Edwards as he walked the 18th fairway 34 Watson finished regulation 72 hole play in the Open tied for the lead with Stewart Cink with a cumulative score of −2 He needed a par on the 72nd hole to capture a sixth career Open Championship title but his second shot on the 72nd hole went over the green Then from several yards behind the 18th green Watson first putted up the slope and past the hole then missed a second 8 foot putt by about 6 inches to the right of the cup His bogey led to a four hole aggregate playoff with Cink running through the 5th 6th 17th and 18th holes With several errant shots not typical of the previous 72 holes he lost the playoff by six strokes 35 The following April Watson competed in the 2010 Masters Tournament Watson shot an opening round 67 one shot off the first round lead held by fellow Champions Tour player Fred Couples Watson subsequently posted rounds of 74 73 and 73 His 72 hole one under par total of 287 gave Watson a share of eighteenth place Watson thus became only the second player in history after Sam Snead to post a top 20 finish in at least one major championship in five different decades Watson holds the record for the longest time span between first and last playoffs on the PGA Tour That time span is 34 years 6 days Watson won the 1975 Open Championship in an 18 hole playoff and 34 years later lost a playoff for the 2009 Open Championship Due to his performance in 2009 and early 2010 along with his 1982 U

professional championships contested at Pebble Beach 1972 1982 1992 2000 and 2010 U S Opens and the 1977 PGA Championship In an interview in 2012 Watson admitted that he was distraught at coming so close to becoming the oldest Major winner at the age of 59 and said that the experience in the 2009 Open Championship tore his guts out Watson said of his approach shot to the green at the 72nd hole when he needed a par to win the Open I was going right at the flag but with the uncertainty of links golf maybe a gust of wind took it a bit further than it was supposed to I felt extreme disappointment that night but the one good thing that came of that was the response of people around the world 36 For the 2015 Open Championship Watson s exemption for his 2009 finish was extended to give him an opportunity to play at St Andrews and make one final Open appearance Watson won Open Championships at five different courses but St Andrews was not among them He missed the cut and made an emotional walk across the Swilcan Bridge at twilight 37 In April 2016 he played in his final Masters After saying in the lead up to the event that he couldn t compete anymore 38 Watson missed the cut

round 3 1990s 1993 PGA Championship 65 in round 2 and 2000s 2000 PGA Championship 65 in round 3 Watson s 67 in the first round at the 2010 Masters also gives him a record to be the only person to have at least one round of 67 or less in any of the four majors in five different decades 1970s 1980s 1990s 2000s and 2010s Watson joined the Champions Tour in 1999 the same year he earned an honorary membership of the Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews in Scotland He has 14 wins on the Champions Tour including six senior majors while playing a limited schedule of events Watson shares with Gary Player and Bernhard Langer three victories for each in the Senior Open Championship Watson revisited his 1977 Open Championship win at Turnberry with another win there in the 2003 Senior Open Championship He followed this up with victories in 2005 and 2007 After residing for many years in Mission Hills Kansas Watson moved to Stilwell Kansas with his wife two children and three stepchildren His house has since been annexed by the city of Overland Park within Johnson County 1 > He designed the National Golf Club of Kansas City golf course Watson has been one of the most complete players ever to play golf as evidenced by his competitiveness in the 2009 Open Championship at the age of 59 Standing 5 ft 9 in and weighing 160 pounds during his PGA Tour years he achieved abundant length with accuracy played aggressively developed a superlative short game and in his prime was a very skilled and confident putter Watson is renowned as an exceptional bad weather golfer having displayed this gritty talent best in the difficult and varied conditions of The Open Championship At the height of his career he was well known for his excellent recovery skills especially around the greens Years later if a player escaped from trouble and somehow made par tour players described the escape as a Watson par 41 Watson also developed a reputation for scrupulous honesty once even calling a penalty stroke on himself for slightly moving a ball that was in deep rough although no one else had seen it 42 In 1991 Watson was critical of the heckling of his playing partner Ian Woosnam during the final round of the Masters Some of the Augusta crowd were vociferous in their support for Watson in the hope of seeing him win a third Masters title Watson however calmed Woosnam after he was upset at being yelled at by a member of the crowd on the 14th tee Watson later said There s been a breakdown in decorum and I don t feel good when partisanship spills over 43 In 2010 Watson said that he agreed with Lee Westwood s assertion that Tour players who used 20 year old Ping Eye 2 wedges to get around new rules prohibiting box grooves i e grooves rectangular including square or U shaped in cross section were going against the spirit of the game Watson also reprimanded Tiger Woods for his language and club throwing and said that Woods needed to show humility to the public 44 Watson has been outspoken about the effect that too much prize money can have on some golfers In an interview in 2010 Watson said I do believe that in certain instances players can be corrupted by the amount of money they make I think too much money corrupts the desire and for some players it s about how much money they make rather than just trying to be the best player they can 45 PGA Tour playoff record

https://wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Open_Championship,Golf,,,The Open Championship often referred to as The Open or the British Open is the oldest golf tournament in the world and one of the most prestigious Founded in 1860 it was originally held annually at Prestwick Golf Club Scotland before evolving to being rotated between a select group of coastal links golf courses in the United Kingdom under the authority of The R A The Open is one of the four men s major golf tournaments the others being the Masters Tournament the PGA Championship and the U S Open Since the PGA Championship moved to May in 2019 the Open has been chronologically the fourth and final major tournament of the year The tournament traditionally takes place over four days in summer starting the day before the third Friday in July It is called The Open because it is in theory open to all i e professional and amateur golfers In practice the current event is a professional tournament in which a small number of the world s leading amateurs also play by invitation or qualification The success of the tournament has led to many other open golf tournaments to be introduced around the world The current champion is Shane Lowry who won the 148th Open at Royal Portrush Golf Club in Northern Ireland with a score of 269 It was also held at Portrush in 1951 the first occasion that it had not been held in Scotland or England The first Open Championship was played on 17 October 1860 at Prestwick Golf Club in Ayrshire Scotland over three rounds of the twelve hole links course 1 In the mid 19th century golf was played mainly by well off gentlemen as hand crafted clubs and balls were expensive Professionals made a living from playing for bets caddying ball and club making and instruction Allan Robertson was the most famous of these pros and was regarded as the undisputed best golfer between 1843 and his death in 1859 2 1 James Ogilvie Fairlie of Prestwick Golf Club decided to form a competition in 1860 to be played for by professional golfers 3 and to decide who would succeed Robertson as the Champion Golfer Blackheath England Perth Bruntsfield Edinburgh Musselburgh and St Andrews golf clubs were invited to send up to three of their best players known as a respectable caddie to represent each of the clubs 4 The winner received the Challenge Belt made from red leather with a silver buckle and worth £25 which came about thanks to being donated by the Earl of Eglinton a man with a keen interest in medieval pageantry belts were the type of trophy that might have been competed for in archery or jousting 5 4 The first rule of the new golf competition was The party winning the belt shall always leave the belt with the treasurer of the club until he produces a guarantee to the satisfaction of the above committee that the belt shall be safely kept and laid on the table at the next meeting to compete for it until it becomes the property of the winner by being won three times in succession 6 Eight golfers contested the event with Willie Park Sr winning the championship by 2 shots from Old Tom Morris and he was declared The Champion Golfer of the Year 7 1 A year later it became open to amateurs as well as professionals Ten professionals and eight amateurs contested the event with Old Tom Morris winning the championship by 4 shots from Willie Park Sr 8 1 A prize fund £10 was introduced in 1863 split between 2nd 3rd and 4th the winner only received the Challenge Belt From 1864 onwards a cash prize was also paid to the winner 9 10 Before this the only financial incentive was scheduling Prestwick s own domestic tournament the same week this allowed professionals to earn a few days work caddying for the wealthier gentlemen 11 Willie Park Sr went on to win two more tournaments and Old Tom Morris three more before Young Tom Morris won three consecutive titles between 1868 and 1870 The rules stated that he was allowed to keep the belt for achieving this feat Because no trophy was available the tournament was not held in 1871 1 On 11 September 1872 agreement was reached between Prestwick the Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers and The Royal and Ancient Golf Club They decided that each of the three clubs would contribute £10 towards the cost of a new trophy which was to be a silver claret jug known officially as The Golf Champion Trophy and hosting of the Open would be rotated between the three clubs These decisions were taken too late for the trophy to be presented to the 1872 Open champion who was once again Young Tom Morris Instead he was awarded with a medal inscribed The Golf Champion Trophy although he is the first to be engraved on the Claret Jug as the 1872 winner Medals have been given to and kept by the winner ever since 6 Young Tom Morris died in 1875 aged 24 12 The tournament continued to be dominated and won by Scottish professionals to be rotated between the three Scottish golf courses and played over 36 holes in a single day until 1889 13 In the 1890s the tournament was won four times by three Englishman two of whom were amateurs 14 In 1892 the tournament was played for the first time at the newly built Muirfield which replaced Musselburgh as the host venue used by the Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers 15 A few years later St George s 16 and Royal Liverpool 17 in England were added to the rotation From 1892 the tournament was increased in duration to four 18 hole rounds over two days 15 Prestwick had been extended to an 18 hole course by then 18 Between 1898 and 1925 the tournament either had a cut after 36 holes or a qualifying event 19 and the largest field was 226 in 1911 20 The large field meant sometimes the tournament was spread across up to four days 21 In 1907 Arnaud Massy from France became the first non British winner 22 Royal Cinque Ports in England became the 6th different Open host course in 1909 23 The pre war period is most famous for the Great Triumvirate of Harry Vardon Jersey John Henry Taylor England and James Braid Scotland The trio combined to win The Open Championship 16 times in the 21 tournaments held between 1894 and 1914 Vardon won six times a record that still stands today with Braid and Taylor winning five apiece In the five tournaments in this span the Triumvirate did not win one or more of them finished runner up These rivalries enormously increased the public s interest in golf but the first world war meant another Open was not held until 1920 and none of the trio won another Open 24 In 1920 the Open returned and The Royal and Ancient Golf Club became the sole organiser of the Open Championship In 1926 they standardised the format of the tournament to spread over three days 18 holes on day 1 and 2 and 36 on day 3 and include both qualifying and a cut 19 In 1921 eleven U S based players travelled to Scotland financed by a popular subscription called the British Open Championship Fund after a campaign by the American magazine Golf Illustrated 25 Five of these players were actually British born and had emigrated to America to take advantage of the high demand for club professionals as the popularity of golf grew 26 A match was played between the Americans and a team of British professionals which is seen as a forerunner of the Ryder Cup 27 When the Open was held two weeks later one of these visitors Jock Hutchison a naturalised American citizen won in St Andrews the town of his birth 28 In 1922 Walter Hagen won the first of his four Opens and become the first American born winner The period between 1923 and 1933 saw an American based player win every year two were British born and included three wins by amateur Bobby Jones and one by Gene Sarazen who had already won top tournaments in the United States English players won every year between 1934 and 1939 including two wins by Henry Cotton he would go on to win a third in 1948 1 After overcrowding issues at the 1925 Open at Prestwick it was decided it was no longer suitable for the growing size of the event being too short having too many blind shots and it could not cope with the volume of spectators 29 The Open s original venue was replaced on the rota with Carnoustie 30 which hosted for the first time in 1931 Troon hosted for the first time in 1923 31 and Royal Lytham St Annes was also added hosting for the first time in 1926 32 Prince s hosted its one and only Open in 1932 33 The Open returned after the war to St Andrews with a victory for American Sam Snead Bobby Locke became the first South African winner winning three times in four years between 1949 and 1952 and later winning a fourth title in 1957 Having already won the Masters and the U S Open earlier in the year Ben Hogan won in his one and only Open appearance in 1953 to win the Triple Crown 1 His achievement was so well regarded he returned to New York City to a ticker tape parade 34 Peter Thomson became the first Australian winner winning four times in five years between 1954 and 1958 and later winning a fifth title in 1965 1 After flooding prevented Royal Cinque Ports from hosting both in 1938 and 1949 it was removed from the rota 35 The Open was played outside of England and Scotland for the first time in 1951 at Royal Portrush Northern Ireland 36 The period saw fewer American entrants as the PGA Tour had grown to be quite lucrative and the PGA Championship was often played at the same or similar time paying triple the prize money 37 38 A larger golf ball was also used in America which meant they had to adjust for the Open 39 In 1959 Gary Player a young South African won the first of his three Opens Only four Americans had entered but in 1960 Arnold Palmer travelled to Scotland after winning the Masters and U S Open in an attempt to emulate Hogan s 1953 feat of winning all three tournaments in a single year Although he finished second to Kel Nagle he returned and won the Open in 1961 and 1962 Palmer was hugely popular in America and his victories are likely to have been the first time many Americans would have seen the Open on television This along with the growth of trans Atlantic jet travel inspired many more Americans to travel in the future 1 The period is primarily defined by the competition between Player Palmer and Jack Nicklaus Nicklaus won three times 1966 1970 1978 and had a record seven runner ups American Lee Trevino also made his mark winning his two Opens back to back in 1971 and 1972 the latter denying Nicklaus a calendar year Grand Slam 1 The only British champion in this period was Tony Jacklin 40 and it is also notable for having the first winner from Argentina Roberto De Vicenzo 41 By 1975 the concept of the modern majors had been firmly established and the PGA Championship had been moved to August since 1969 38 so no longer clashed with the Open This meant the Open had a feel similar to the current tournament with the leaders after 36 holes going off last 1957 onwards 42 all players having to use the bigger ball 1974 onwards 43 44 45 play spread over four days 1966 onwards although the days were Wednesday to Saturday until 1980 46 47 and a field containing all the world s best players American Tom Watson won in 1975 Turnberry hosted for the first time in 1977 and Watson won the Open for the second time after one of the most celebrated contests in golf history when his duel with Jack Nicklaus went to the final shot before Watson emerged as the champion He would go on to win again in 1980 1982 and 1983 to win 5 times overall 1 a record only bettered by Harry Vardon and he became regarded as one of the greatest links golf players of all time 48 In 1976 19 year old Spaniard Seve Ballesteros gained attention in the golfing world when he finished second 49 He would go on to win three Opens 1979 1984 1988 and was the first continental European to win since Arnaud Massy in 1907 Other multiple winners in this period were Englishman Nick Faldo with three 1987 1990 1992 and Australian Greg Norman with two 1986 1993 1 Every year between 1994 and 2004 had a first time winner 50 In 1999 the Open at Carnoustie was famously difficult and Frenchman Jean van de Velde had a three shot lead teeing off on the final hole He ended up triple bogeying after finding the Barry Burn and Scotman Paul Lawrie ranked 241st in the world ended up winning in a playoff He was 10 strokes behind the leader going into the final round a record for all majors 51 He was not the only unheralded champion during this span as 396th ranked Ben Curtis 52 and 56th ranked Todd Hamilton 53 won in 2003 and 2004 respectively In 2000 Tiger Woods having just won the U S Open became champion by a post war record 8 strokes 54 to become the youngest player to win the career Grand Slam at age 24 1 After winning the 2002 Masters and U S Open he became the latest American to try to emulate Ben Hogan and win the Open in the same year His bid came to a halt on Saturday with the worst round of his career up to that time an 81 +10 in cold gusty rain 55 He went on to win again back to back in 2005 and 2006 to bring his total to three wins Other multiple winners in this era are South African Ernie Els 2002 2012 and Irishman Pádraig Harrington 2007 2008 1 50 In 2009 59 year old Tom Watson led the tournament through 71 holes and needed just a par on the last hole to become the oldest ever winner of a major championship and also match Harry Vardon s six Opens Watson bogeyed setting up a four hole playoff which he lost to Stewart Cink 56 In 2015 Jordan Spieth became another American to arrive having already won the year s Masters and U S Open tournaments He finished tied for fourth as Zach Johnson became champion 57 Spieth would go on to win the 2017 Open at Royal Birkdale 50 American Phil Mickelson won his first Open and fifth major in 2013 50 In 2016 he was involved in an epic duel with Sweden s Henrik Stenson which many people compared to the 1977 Duel in the Sun between Jack Nicklaus and Tom Watson Stenson emerged the winner and the first Scandinavian winner of a male professional major championship with a record Open and major score of 264 −20 three shots ahead of Mickelson and 14 shots ahead of third place Jack Nicklaus shared his thoughts on the final round saying Phil Mickelson played one of the best rounds I have ever seen played in the Open and Henrik Stenson just played better—he played one of the greatest rounds I have ever seen 58 59 Francesco Molinari won the 2018 Open at Carnoustie by two shots to become the first Italian major winner 60 Shane Lowry won the 2019 Open when the tournament returned to Royal Portrush Golf Club to become the second champion from the Republic of Ireland 61 In 2020 the Open Championship was cancelled because of the COVID 19 pandemic It was the first time the championship had been cancelled since World War II The R A also confirmed that Royal St George s which would have hosted the championship in 2020 would be the host venue in 2021 effectively retaining the Old Course at St Andrews as the venue for the 150th Open 62 The Open is always played on a coastal links golf course Links golf is often described as the purest form of golf and keeps a connection with the way the game originated in Scotland in the 15th century The terrain is open often without any trees and will generally be undulating with a sandy base The golf courses are often primarily shaped by nature rather than built Weather particularly wind plays an important role and although there will be a prevailing onshore breeze changes in the wind direction and strength over the course of the tournament can mean each round of golf has to be played slightly differently The courses are also famous for deep pot bunkers and gorse bushes that make up the rough A golfer playing on a links course will often adapt his game so the flight of the ball is lower and so is less impacted by the wind but this will make distance control more difficult Also due to the windy conditions the speed of the greens are often slower than a golfer might be used to on the PGA Tour to avoid the ball being moved by a gust 63 64 The Old Course at St Andrews is regarded as the oldest golf course in the world and winning the Open there is often regarded as one of the pinnacles of golf 65 Given the special status of the Old Course the Open is generally played there once every five years in the modern era much more frequently than the other courses used for the Open 66 Previous champions will often choose St Andrews as their final Open tournament It has become traditional to come down the 18th fairway to huge applause from the amphitheatre crowds and to pose for final pictures on the Swilken Bridge with the picturesque clubhouse and town in the background 67 The Open trophy is the Claret Jug which has been presented to the champion since 1873 The original trophy permanently resides on display in the R A s Clubhouse at St Andrews Therefore the trophy that is presented at each Open is a replica which is retained by the winner for a year It used to be the responsibility of the winner then get their name engraved on the trophy but 1967 winner Roberto De Vicenzo returned the trophy without having done so 68 Subsequently the winner s name is already engraved on it when presented which often results in television commentators speculating as to when it is safe for the engraver to start 69 The winner of the Open is announced as The Champion Golfer of the Year a title which has been used since the first Open in 1860 He will nearly always pose for photos with the trophy sitting on one of the distinctive pot bunkers 70 The first event was held as an invitational tournament but the next year Prestwick Golf Club declared that the belt on all future occasions shall be open to all the world 71 In its early years it was often referred to as The Championship but with the advent of the Amateur Championship in 1885 it became more common to refer to it as The Open Championship or simply The Open The tournament inspired other national bodies to introduce open golf tournaments of their own such as the U S Open and later many others 72 To distinguish it from their own national open it became common in many countries to refer to the tournament as the British Open The R A the tournament s organiser continued to refer to it as The Open Championship During the interwar years a period with many U S based winners the term British Open would occasionally be used during the trophy presentation and in British newspapers 73 74 In 2017 a representative of the R A openly stated that it is a priority to eradicate the term British Open and have a single identity and brand of The Open in all countries 75 Tournament partners such as the PGA Tour now refer to it without British in the title 76 media rightsholders are contractually required to refer to the event as The Open Championship 75 and the official website has released a statement titled Why it s called The Open and not the British Open stating that The Open is the correct name for the Championship It is also the most appropriate 72 The R A s stance has attracted criticism from some commentators 75 77 78 The R A also run The Senior Open the over 50s equivalent of the Open which was officially known as the Senior British Open from its inception in 1987 until 2007 when British was dropped from the name 79 The Women s Open seen by some as the women s equivalent to the Open although unlike the Open it is not always held on a links course and was not run by the R A until 2017 was officially known as the Women s British Open from its inception in 1976 until 2020 when the word British was dropped from the name as part of a sponsorship deal with AIG 80 The Open is recognised as one of the four major championships in golf and is an official event on the PGA Tour European Tour and the Japan Golf Tour The Open began in 1860 and for many years it was not the most followed event in golf as challenge matches between top golfers were more keenly followed and drew larger crowds 81 The Great Triumvirate dominated the Open between 1894 and 1914 and were primarily responsible for the formation of the PGA in 1901 which had a big impact in promoting interest in professional golf and therefore The Open and increasing playing standards 82 Between the World Wars the first wins by Americans were widely celebrated when they broke the dominance previously held by British players 83 After World War II although the profile of the tournament remained high in the UK and Commonwealth countries the low prize money compared to the US events and the cost of travel meant fewer Americans participated High profile visits and wins by Ben Hogan and Arnold Palmer the growth of cheaper and faster transatlantic flights and the introduction of television coverage recovered its prestige 1 When the modern concept of the majors was cemented the Open was included as one of those four Thus the Open is now one of the four majors in golf along with the U S Open PGA Championship and Masters Tournament The term major is a universally acknowledged unofficial term used by players the media and golf followers to define the most important tournaments and performance in them is often used to define the careers of the best golfers 84 There is often discussion amongst the golfing community as to whether the Open U S Open or the Masters Tournament is the most prestigious major but opinion varies often linked to nationality The PGA Championship is usually seen as the least prestigious of the four 85 86 In terms of official recognition the tournament has been an event on the European Tour since its formation in 1972 The PGA Tour added it as its first official event outside of the United States and Canada in 1995 in addition all previous PGA Tour seasons have been retroactively adjusted to include the Open in official money and win statistics Currently the Open along with the other three majors and The Players Championship are the top tier tournaments in the FedEx cup offering more points than any other non playoff event The Open is also an official event on the Japan Golf Tour 87 Qualifying was introduced in 1907 and for much of its history all players had to go through the qualification process In the modern era the majority of players get an exemption from qualification which is awarded for previous performance in the Open performance in high profile global tournaments such as other majors performance in top golf tours or a high position in the Official World Golf Ranking OWGR Five amateurs are also exempt from qualifying by winning various global amateur titles provided they maintain their amateur status prior to The Open 88 Another way of qualifying is to finish in a high position in the Open Qualifying Series of global events which are about twelve tour events across the globe run by various local golfing organisations 89 Any male professional golfer male amateur golfer whose playing handicap does not exceed 0 4 i e scratch or has been within World Amateur Golf Ranking listing 1–2 000 during the current calendar year and any female golfer who finished in the top 5 and ties in the latest edition of any of the five women s majors is eligible to enter local qualifying If they perform well they will go on to Final Qualifying which is four simultaneous 36 hole one day events held across the UK with 12 players qualifying for the Open 89 If there are any spots left then alternates are made up from the highest ranked players in the OWGR who are not already qualified which brings the total field up to 156 players 90 In 2018 the OWGR gave the Open a strength of field rating of 902 the maximum possible is 1000 if the top 200 players in the world were all in a tournament This was only bettered by the PGA Championship a tournament which actively targets a high strength of field rating 91 92 Field 156 players 93 Basic Format 72 hole stroke play Play 18 holes a day over four days weather permitting 93 Date of Tournament Starts on the day before the third Friday in July 94 Tournament Days Thursday to Sunday 93 Tee off times Each player has one morning and one afternoon tee time in first two days in groups of three which are mostly randomised with some organiser discretion Groupings of two on the last two days with last place going off first and leaders going out last 95 Cut After 36 holes only top 70 and ties play the final 36 holes 93 Playoff If there is a tie for the lead after 72 holes a three hole aggregate playoff is held followed by sudden death if the lead is still tied 93 Up until 2016 the purse was always stated and paid in pounds sterling £ but was changed in 2017 to US dollars $ in recognition of the fact that it is the most widely adopted currency for prize money in golf 96 The champion receives trophies the winner s prize money and several exemptions from world golf tours and tournaments He is also likely to receive a winner s bonus from his sponsors 97 The prizes and privileges on offer for the champion included From 1860 to 1870 the winner received the challenge belt When this was awarded to Young Tom Morris permanently for winning three consecutive tournaments it was replaced by the gold medal 1872 onwards and the claret jug 1873 onwards 99 There are several benefits from being placed highly in the Open These are Since 1949 the leading amateur completing the final round receives a silver medal Since 1972 any other amateur who competes in the final round receives a bronze medal 99 Amateurs do not receive prize money 111 The Professional Golfers Association of Great Britain and Ireland also mark the achievements of their own members in The Open The Braid Taylor Memorial Medal and the Tooting Bec Cup are restricted to members born in or with a parent or parents born in the United Kingdom or Republic of Ireland 98 The Open Championship has always been held on a coastal links golf course in Scotland England or Northern Ireland The hosting pattern has been 66 A total of 14 courses have hosted the Open with ten currently active as part of the rotation and four have been retired from the rotation shown in italics The year the golf course was originally built is shown in parenthesis Prestwick Golf Club 1851 120 Prestwick is The Open s original venue and hosted 24 Opens in all including the first 12 66 Old Tom Morris designed the original 12 hole course 120 but it was subsequently redesigned and expanded to be an 18 hole course in 1882 121 Serious overcrowding problems at Prestwick in 1925 meant that the course was never again used for the Open and was replaced by Carnoustie Golf Links as the third Scottish course 29 30 Old Course at St Andrews 1552 122 Considered the oldest golf course in the world and referred to as the home of golf Famous features include the Hell Bunker 14th and the Road Hole 17th 123 Due to its special status it usually hosts the open every five years in the modern era 66 It is designed to be played in wind so can result in low scores in benign conditions 124 Musselburgh Links c1672 122 A 9 hole course that hosted six Opens as it was used by the Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers one of the organisers of The Open between 1872 and 1920 When the Honourable Company built their own course in 1891 Muirfield it took over hosting duties 125 Musselburgh was unhappy with this and organised another rival Open competition prior to the Muirfield event one with greater prize money 126 Muirfield 1891 Built by the Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers to replace Musselburgh on the rota Known for the circular arrangement the course has which means the wind direction on each hole changes and can make it tricky to navigate 127 Briefly removed from the rota in 2016–17 due to not having any female members 128 129 Royal St George s Golf Club 1887 130 The first venue to host in England and the only venue on the current rota in Southern England It went 32 years without hosting between 1949 and 1981 but returned following the rebuilding of three holes tee changes to another two holes and improved road links 131 Known for having the deepest bunker on the rota 4th hole 132 Royal Liverpool Golf Club 1869 133 Often simply referred to as Hoylake Royal Liverpool went 39 years without hosting between 1967 and 2006 66 but returned following changes to tees bunkers and greens 133 In 2006 Tiger Woods won by using his driver just once 134 Royal Cinque Ports Golf Club 1892 135 Hosted the 1909 and 1920 Opens and was scheduled to host in 1938 and 1949 but both had to be moved to Royal St George s Golf Club due to abnormally high tides flooding the course It was removed from the rota but is still used for qualifying 136 137 138 139 140 Royal Troon Golf Club 1878 141 First used in 1923 instead of Muirfield when some doubts exists as to the Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers being desirous of their course being used for the event 142 Redesigned lengthened and strengthened by James Braid shortly before it held its first Open Famous features include the Postage Stamp 8th hole and the 601 yards 6th 141 Royal Lytham St Annes Golf Club 1886 143 A relatively short course but has 167 bunkers which demand accuracy 144 Slightly inland as some coastal homes have been built since the course first opened 143 Carnoustie Golf Links 1835 122 Replaced Prestwick after it was no longer suitable for the Open 30 It went through modifications prior to the 1999 Open Thought of as being the toughest of the Open venues especially the last three holes and is well remembered for Jean van de Velde triple bogeying on the 18th when he only needed a double bogey to win 51 Prince s Golf Club 1906 Only hosted once in 1932 Has been redesigned in 1950 due to war damage 145 Royal Portrush Golf Club 1888 146 The only venue to host the Open outside England and Scotland when it hosted in 1951 With the Troubles in Northern Ireland significantly diminished since the 1998 Good Friday Agreement and after the successful hosting of the Irish Open it returned as host in 2019 The course underwent significant changes before the 2019 Open including replacing the 17th and 18th holes which also provided the space for spectators and corporate hospitality that a modern major requires 119 Royal Birkdale Golf Club 1894 Extensively redesigned by Fred Hawtree and JH Taylor to create the current layout in 1922 it is known for its sand dunes towering the fairways Often ranked as England s best Open venue 147 148 149 Turnberry 1906 Made its Open debut in 1977 when Tom Watson and Jack Nicklaus famously played the Duel in the Sun Known to be one of the most picturesque Open venues it was bought by Donald Trump in 2014 who has spent substantial amounts renovating the course 150 On 11 January 2021 the week after the 2021 storming of the United States Capitol the R A announced that it will not stage a championship at Turnberry in the foreseeable future 151 152 References 66 60 Nationalities assigned below match those used in the official Open records Reference  The 148th Open 2019 Media Guide 159 Since 1949 the silver medal is awarded to the leading amateur provided that the player completes all 72 holes 99 In the earlier years wealthy individuals would often maintain their amateur status and hence could win multiple times such as Frank Stranahan who won it four times in the first five years and was also the low amateur in 1947 In the modern era players often turn professional soon after winning the silver medal and hence never have a chance for multiple wins Tiger Woods and Rory McIlroy are the only silver medal winners who have gone on to win the Open The distribution of The Open is provided by a partnership between R A Productions European Tour Productions both run by IMG and CTV Outside Broadcasting The broadcasters with onsite production are Sky UK NBC USA BBC UK and TV Asahi Japan 160 Many non British broadcasters referred to the Open as the British Open in their coverage until 2010 when The R A introduced use of contractual terms in their media contracts similar to the Masters and now rights holders are obliged to refer to the tournament as The Open 75 On 7 November 2018 the parent company of the U S rights holder NBC completed a takeover of the U K rights holder Sky This means the media rights in the two primary markets are owned by the same company albeit produced separately by two different subsidiaries 161 There are over 170 cameras on site during the tournament including cameras in the face of the Open s pot bunkers 162 163 Television rights history Ref 164 165 166 167 Current broadcast hours for live coverage Ref 168 The BBC first started to broadcast the Open in 1955 164 with Peter Alliss involved since 1961 and having the role of lead commentator since 1978 169 With the growth of pay television and the increasing value of sporting rights the BBC s golf portfolio began to reduce The loss of the rights to the Scottish Open and BMW PGA Championship in 2012 left the BBC s only golf coverage as the Open and the final two days of the Masters which it shared with Sky With so little golf the BBC was accused of neglecting investment in production and was criticised about its quality of coverage and innovation compared to Sky which held the rights to most golf events The tournament is considered a Category B event under the Ofcom Code on Sports and Other Listed and Designated Events which allows its rights to be held by a pay television broadcaster as long as sufficient secondary coverage is provided by a free to air broadcaster 170 164 171 Many were hoping that a deal similar to the Masters would be reached where Sky had coverage of all four days and the BBC also provided live weekend coverage but Sky were not keen on this and won the full rights in 2015 Some were angered about the demise of golf on terrestrial television and the impact that could have on the interest in golf in the U K 172 173 whilst others were pleased about the perceived improved coverage that Sky would give 174 Despite Peter Alliss promising on air that the BBC would cover the 2016 event the BBC reached a deal for Sky to take the coverage The BBC still covers the tournament showing highlights from 8pm–10pm on tournament days and radio coverage on Radio 5 Live The deal with Sky required the broadcaster to restrict its advertisement breaks to 4 minutes every hour similar to the Masters 174 Sky also offers complete coverage online through NOWtv to non subscribers which is £7 99 for one day or £12 99 for a weeks access 175 Television rights history Ref 176 Current broadcast hours for live coverage East Coast Ref 177 ABC began broadcasting the Open in 1962 with taped highlights on Wide World of Sports 178 In the pre digital age the coverage had to be converted from the U K s PAL colour encoding system to the U S s NTSC which meant picture quality could be impacted especially in the early years 179 The coverage expanded over the years and as is common in America there was a different early round rights holder which was ESPN until 2003 when TNT took over Co owned ESPN became responsible for ABC s sports coverage in 2006 it won the rights to cover all four days of the championship in 2010 and concurrently moved coverage to its channels The Open became the first golf major to be covered exclusively on pay television in America as ESPN left only highlights for its partner broadcast network After losing the rights to the U S Open in 2015 NBC bid aggressively to win the rights to the Open and become a broadcaster of a golf major again 178 NBC also had a track record of broadcasting European sporting events successfully in the morning U S time with the Premier League Formula One and Breakfast at Wimbledon and was able to place early round coverage on its subsidiary Golf Channel 180 176 NBC won the rights from 2017 to 2028 181 163 ESPN also sold them the rights for 2016 182 The 2019 edition of the Open Championship had a total of 49 hours of coverage in the United States with 29 hours being on Thursday and Friday and 20 hours being on Saturday and Sunday the Golf Channel cable network had a total of 34 hours of coverage with 29 hours on Thursday and Friday and 5 hours on Saturday and Sunday The NBC broadcast network had a total of 15 hours of coverage on the weekend with 8 hours Saturday and 7 hours Sunday The 49 total hours of coverage on Golf Channel and NBC is down 30 minutes from 2018 the difference is that NBC s Sunday coverage is down 30 minutes from 7 5 hours in 2018 to 7 hours in 2019 The Open provides limited coverage for free on its website including highlights featured groups featured holes and radio coverage The Open s local rights holders usually provide these feeds as part of their broadcast package 183 The Open produces a world feed for use by international broadcasters if they require 160 The other large golf markets in a similar time zone as the U K are the rest of Europe where Sky the U K broadcast company often has a presence and South Africa where it is covered by SuperSport 184 Japan South Korea Australia New Zealand and increasingly China are markets

https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_Sarazen,Golf,,,Gene Sarazen ˈsɑːrəzɛn 1 February 27 1902 – May 13 1999 was an American professional golfer one of the world s top players in the 1920s and 1930s and the winner of seven major championships He is one of five players along with Ben Hogan Gary Player Jack Nicklaus and Tiger Woods to win each of the four majors at least once now known as the Career Grand Slam U S Open 1922 1932 PGA Championship 1922 1923 1933 The Open Championship 1932 2 and Masters Tournament 1935 Born as Eugenio Saraceni in Harrison New York 3 his parents were poor Sicilian immigrants 4 Sarazen began caddying at age ten at local golf clubs took up golf himself and gradually developed his skills he was essentially self taught Somewhat novel at the time he used the interlocking grip to hold the club Sarazen took a series of club professional jobs in the New York area from his mid teens In 1921 he became a professional at Titusville Pa Country Club and he contracted to be the professional at Highland Country Club near Pittsburgh Pa in 1922 He arrived in April stocked the golf shop and gave a few lessons but spent most of his time at Oakmont Country Club practicing with Emil Loeffler At some point the pair visited Skokie Country Club to practice on the course that would hold the U S Open in July he came from four shots behind to win the tournament 5 He returned to Pittsburgh and was feted at the William Penn Hotel where he burst from a paper mâché golf ball 6 He did not return to Highland CC broke his contract and became a touring golf professional Later that summer he won the PGA Championship at Oakmont He was a contemporary and rival of amateur Bobby Jones who was born in the same year Sarazen also had many battles with Walter Hagen who was nine years older Sarazen Jones and Hagen were the world s dominant players during the 1920s Rivalries among the three great champions significantly expanded interest in golf around the world during this period and made the United States the world s dominant golf power for the first time taking over this position from Great Britain Sarazen has a plaque in his honor placed 195 yards out from the 15th green at Hororata Golf Club where he famously made a double eagle in the final round of sectional qualifiers He earned his spot in his first United States Open in 1920 at age 18 Some say it was his greatest achievement as an amateur The winner of 38 PGA tour events Sarazen was inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame in 1974 He was the Associated Press Male Athlete of the Year in 1932 and won the PGA Tour s first Lifetime Achievement Award in 1996 He played on six U S Ryder Cup teams 1927 1929 1931 1933 1935 and 1937 Sarazen claimed to have invented the modern sand wedge 7 and debuted the club while keeping it secret during preliminary practice rounds at The Open Championship at Prince s Golf Club in 1932 which he won He called it the sand iron and his original club is no longer on display at Prince s as it is worth too much for the insurers to cover However a similar club was patented in 1928 by Edwin Kerr McClain and it is possible Sarazen saw this club 8 Sarazen had previously struggled with his sand play and there had been earlier sand specific clubs But Bobby Jones s sand club for example had a concave face which actually contacted the ball twice during a swing this design was later banned Sarazen s innovation was to weld solder onto the lower back of the club building up the flange so that it sat lower than the leading edge when soled The flange not the leading edge would contact the sand first and explode sand as the shot was played The additional weight provided punch to power through the thick sand Sarazen s newly developed technique with the new club was to contact the sand a couple of inches behind the ball not actually contacting the ball at all on most sand shots Every top class golfer since has utilized this wedge design and technique and the same club design and method are also used by amateur players around the world The sand wedge also began to be used by top players for shots from grass shortly after Sarazen introduced it and this led to a revolution in short game techniques along with lower scoring by players who mastered the skills Sarazen hit the shot heard round the world at Augusta National Golf Club on the fifteenth hole in the final round of the Masters Tournament in 1935 He struck a spoon the loft of the modern four wood 232 yards 212 m into the hole scoring a double eagle At the time he was trailing Craig Wood by three shots and was then tied with Wood Sarazen parred the 16th 17th and 18th holes to preserve the tie The following day the pair played a 36 hole playoff with Sarazen winning by five shots The Sarazen Bridge approaching the left side of the 15th green was named in 1955 to commemorate the double eagle s twentieth anniversary 9 10 which included a contest to duplicate with the closest just over 4 feet 1 2 m away 11 It remains one of the most famous shots in golf history In spite of his height of 5 ft 5+1⁄2 in 1 66 m 12 Sarazen was one of the longest hitters of his era He played several lengthy exhibition tours around the world promoting his skills and the sport of golf and earned a very good living from golf As a multiple past champion he was eligible to continue competing after his best years were past and occasionally did so in the top events well into the 1960s and occasionally into the 1970s Throughout his life Sarazen competed wearing knickers or plus fours which were the fashion when he broke into the top level For many years after his retirement Sarazen was a familiar figure as an honorary starter at the Masters From 1981 to 1999 he joined Byron Nelson and Sam Snead in hitting a ceremonial tee shot before each Masters tournament He also popularized the sport with his role as a commentator on the Wonderful World of Golf television show and was an early TV broadcaster at important events At age 71 Sarazen made a hole in one at The Open Championship in 1973 at the Postage Stamp at Troon in Scotland In 1992 he was voted the Bob Jones Award the highest honor given by the United States Golf Association in recognition of distinguished sportsmanship in golf Sarazen had what is still the longest running endorsement contract in professional sports – with Wilson Sporting Goods from 1923 until his death a total of 75 years 13 He received an honorary degree in 1978 from Siena College in Loudonville New York In 1998 shortly before his death the Sarazen Student Union was named in his honor He also established an endowed scholarship fund at the college The Gene and Mary Sarazen Scholarship which is awarded annually to students reflecting the high personal athletic and intellectual ideals of Dr Sarazen For many years kitted in his signature plus fours he hit the first ball in an annual golf tournament held to raise funds for the scholarship 14 Sarazen died at age 97 in 1999 from complications of pneumonia in Naples Florida His wife Mary died thirteen years earlier in 1986 and they are interred at Marco Island Cemetery in Marco 15 In 2000 Sarazen was ranked as the 11th greatest golfer of all time by Golf Digest magazine 16 In 2018 T J Auclair ranked Sarazen as the ninth greatest golfer of all time 17

third place finishes between 1999 and 2003 Mickelson s inability to win any of them led to him frequently being described as the best player never to win a major 23 Mickelson s first major

from his long standing contract with Titleist Acushnet Golf after an incident when he left a voicemail message for a Callaway Golf executive In it he praised their driver and golf ball and thanked them for their help in getting some equipment for his brother This memo was played to all of their salesmen and eventually found its way back to Titleist He was then let out of his multi year deal with Titleist 16 months early and signed on with Callaway Golf his current equipment sponsor He endured a great deal of ridicule and scrutiny from the press and fellow Ryder Cup members for his equipment change so close to the Ryder Cup matches He faltered at the 2004 Ryder Cup with a 1–3–0 record but refused to blame the sudden change in equipment or his practice methods for his performance

the winners of the first two Masters tournaments Horton Smith and Gene Sarazen in 1934 and 1935 respectively It was the first sudden death playoff at The Masters the previous six playoffs were 18 hole rounds on Monday except 1935 which was 36 holes For much of his career Zoeller was famous for waving a white towel in mock surrender from the fairway of the 72nd hole of the 1984 U S Open after Greg

Zoeller then smiled snapped his fingers and walked away before turning and adding or collard greens or whatever the hell they serve 6 K Mart and Dunlop ceased sponsoring Zoeller after the incident 7 8 I know Fuzzy and it was obvious to me that he was attempting to be funny fellow golf professional Tom Lehman said He probably would have said the same thing to Tiger s face and they both would have yukked it up But it wasn t the best timing and it wasn t in good taste It s not appropriate 6 I ve been on the tour for 23 years and anybody who knows me knows that I am a jokester Zoeller said It s too bad that something I said in jest was turned into something it s not But I didn t mean anything by it and I m sorry if I offend anybody If Tiger is offended by it I apologize to him too I have nothing but the utmost respect for Tiger as a person and an athlete 9 Zoeller later offered an apology directly to Woods which Woods accepted 10 On February 13 2007 Zoeller sued Josef Silny Associates

14 15 However Zoeller dropped the lawsuit in December 2007 after being unsuccessful in finding the poster 16 Zoeller was unable to sue Wikipedia for the statements due to protections accorded to

https://wikipedia.org/wiki/J._B._Holmes,Golf,,,John Bradley J B Holmes born April 26 1982 is an American professional golfer who plays on the PGA Tour Holmes born in Campbellsville Kentucky began to play on the varsity golf team at Taylor County High School in Campbellsville when he was in the third grade 3 4 He suffered a mild form of dyslexia when in school 5 Holmes childhood friend Brandon Parsons is his caddy While in high school he played on the Pepsi Junior Golf Tour He attended the University of Kentucky in Lexington helping to achieve SEC Title while there and represented the United States in the 2005 Walker Cup before turning professional later that year 6 Holmes was medalist at the 2005 PGA Tour Qualifying Tournament He tied for tenth in his first PGA Tour start at the 2006 Sony Open in Hawaii and in February that year he won the FBR Open making him the fastest golfer to reach $1 000 000 in career earnings on the PGA Tour It was his fifth tournament as a professional and his fourth on the PGA Tour After this victory his form fell away and this continued in 2007 when he made only 2 top ten finishes and ended the year in 118th place on the money list On February 3 2008 Holmes won the FBR Open for the second Tour win of his career and also captured the tournament title for the second time in three years Starting the final round with a four shot lead on the 18th tee he was one shot behind Phil Mickelson Holmes birdied the 18th to force a play off and then defeated Mickelson on the first playoff hole the 18th by making a six foot birdie putt after a 359 yard drive 7 This victory took Holmes to 62nd in the Official World Golf Ranking In 2008 Holmes reached a career high 42nd in the OWGR Holmes along with fellow 2006 rookies such as Camilo Villegas and Bubba Watson is known for hitting the ball long distances in excess of 300 yards 312 7 yards ranking him number 2 in driving distance only 6 yards behind the leader Watson As such he plays courses by routinely hitting his driver as far as he can reminiscent of John Daly s Grip it and Rip It philosophy and using his distance advantage to put him closer to the green and in position for a wedge or short iron to the green While the style of play is not new many critics have complained that J B Holmes s style has ushered in a new wave of golfers dedicated to smashing the ball as far as they can assisted by the newer golf equipment offered by golf club companies and hacking the ball out of the rough onto the green effectively eliminating the equalizing effect that the sport of golf usually affords shorter accurate hitters In the 2008 Ryder Cup Holmes defeated Europe s Søren Hansen 2 1 during Sunday s singles matches to bring the United States within one point of clinching the Ryder Cup Jim Furyk would later defeat Miguel Ángel Jiménez on the 17th hole to clinch the Ryder Cup Holmes and another Ryder Cup teammate Kenny Perry were named Kentuckians of the Year for 2008 by Kentucky Monthly magazine After shooting an 80 in the first round Holmes withdrew from the 2011 PGA Championship in August He had been dealing with vertigo symptoms for several months and eventually was diagnosed with structural defects in the cerebellum known as Chiari malformations 8 He underwent brain surgery on September 1 2011 and about a month later doctors discovered that Holmes was allergic to the adhesive used on the webbed titanium plate at the base of his skull He was airlifted from his home in Kentucky to Johns Hopkins in Baltimore for another surgery Holmes returned to the PGA Tour in late January 2012 at the Farmers Insurance Open 9 10 After brain surgery Holmes played in 26 events in 2012 Elbow and ankle injuries limited him to six PGA Tour events in 2013 and did not play again until the Dunlop Phoenix Tournament on the Japan Golf Tour Holmes satisfied his medical extension through earnings at the 2014 Zurich Classic of New Orleans finishing T11 He would need a T63 at the Wells Fargo Championship to earn entry into the 2014 Players Championship via FedEx Cup points Holmes would get his first win in six years regained his Tour status through the 2015–2016 season and moved from 242nd to 68th in the Official World Golf Ranking 11 The win also earned Holmes entry into the 2014 PGA Championship at Valhalla Golf Club in Louisville Kentucky In February 2015 Holmes lost in a four man sudden death playoff at the Farmers Insurance Open He held a co lead after the 54 hole stage with Harris English but could only shoot a level par final round to enter the playoff At the first playoff hole Holmes made a birdie to move on to the second playoff hole with Jason Day after English and Scott Stallings were eliminated with pars On the par three second playoff hole Holmes flew the green and could not get down in two from the back rough leaving Day with two putts from 15 feet for the victory In the first round of the WGC Cadillac Championship Holmes shot a 62 for a total of 10 under par to lead by four strokes after the first day His round included eight birdies and an eagle to tie the tournament record Holmes retained his lead after the second round despite a one over par 73 He led by two shots going into the weekend and opened up a five shot lead following a 70 in the third round which included a hole in one at the par 3 fourth hole However his lead had gone by the sixth hole in the final round after he bogeyed three of his opening six holes Holmes played the rest of his round in even par and would go on to shoot a 75 to finish one behind winner Dustin Johnson His runner up finish moved Holmes to 19th in the world rankings his highest ever placing to date In January 2018 Holmes was criticized by his fellow pros on social media after

https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Moe_Norman,Golf,,,Murray Irwin Moe Norman July 10 1929 – September 4 2004 was a Canadian professional golfer His accuracy and ability to hit shot after shot perfectly straight gave him the nickname Pipeline Moe 1 Born in Kitchener Ontario Canada in 1929 Norman developed his golf from childhood at the Rockway municipal course in that city starting as a caddie in his pre teen years 1 He refined his skills competing against talented area players such as Gary Cowan and Gerry Kesselring Norman spent most of his playing career in poverty He spent many winters setting pins in a bowling alley for a few cents a line 2 Norman s first win was in 1949 when he won a one day amateur event at the St Thomas Golf and Country Club Norman won back to back Canadian Amateur Championships in 1955 and 1956 1 He turned professional in 1957 and played briefly on the PGA Tour but due to shyness bullying he encountered from certain pros and a preference to stay in Canada he stayed primarily in Ontario rather than travel extensively outside Canada 1 In the 80s Norman also played several events on the Senior PGA Tour Late in his life Norman found better financial security when Natural Golf an instruction company and Titleist a major golf manufacturer signed him to a lifetime contract after he allegedly told a reporter Titleist never did nothing for me Moe would often perform golf exhibitions across Canada – Wally Uihlein president of Titleist considered Moe s lifetime contract a Reverse Scholarship Norman died in 2004 in a Kitchener hospital from congestive heart failure having suffered from the condition since heart bypass surgery six years earlier He also had a heart attack two years before his death Norman was self taught and never took a golf lesson 1 Norman s skills as a ball striker are legendary Sam Snead described Norman as the greatest striker of the ball In January 2005 Tiger Woods the biggest golf star of the modern era told Golf Digest s Jaime Diaz that only two golfers in history have owned their swings Moe Norman and Ben Hogan 1 Stated Woods I want to own mine Norman s play along with his way of dressing were both unconventional He wore long sleeved shirts in any weather buttoned to his chin and his pants didn t fit very well 2 He devised what is known as The Single Plane Golf Swing — rigid arms extended far from his body a very wide stance with minimal knee bend shorter than usual backswing and extended follow through with minimal hand action which produced amazingly accurate ball placement 1 He played extremely fast sometimes not slowing to line up his putts Norman was known for sometimes unconventional behavior on the course 1 It is said that on one hole his caddie told him he could get to the green with a driver and a 9 iron Naturally he hit off the tee with his 9 iron and then hit the green with his driver In an exhibition match in 1990 rather than lay up short of a creek hazard which could not be carried he rolled his drive across the bridge which crossed the creek 2 Norman played the PGA Tour beginning in 1959 After a tournament in New Orleans PGA officials gave Norman a dressing down regarding his playing antics Feeling let down by the PGA s attitude towards him Norman returned to Canada to play golf Norman s record on the PGA Tour Additionally Norman played on the Senior PGA Tour from 1981 to 1984 Norman s golf achievements and eccentric personality inspired many articles and biographic books including The Feeling of Greatness – The Moe Norman Story by Tim O Connor mw parser
